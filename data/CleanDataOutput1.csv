one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just oz episode youll be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with methe first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word go trust me this is not show for the faint hearted or timid this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence its is hardcore in the classic use of the wordit is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary it focuses mainly on emerald city an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards so privacy is not high on the agenda em city is home to manyaryans muslims gangstas latinos christians italians irish and moreso scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far awayi would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldnt dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romanceoz doesnt mess around the first episode ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal couldnt say was ready for it but as watched more developed taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards wholl be sold out for nickel inmates wholl kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewingthats if you can get in touch with your darker side,positive
wonderful little production the filming technique is very unassuming very oldtimebbc fashion and gives comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece the actors are extremely well chosen michael sheen not only has got all the polari but he has all the voices down pat too you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is terrificly written and performed piece masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life the realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with halliwells murals decorating every surface are terribly well done,positive
thought this was wonderful way to spend time on too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching lighthearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point risk addiction thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to lovethis was the most id laughed at one of woodys comedies in years dare say decade while ive never been impressed with scarlet johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into average but spirited young womanthis may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than devil wears prada and more interesting than superman great comedy to go see with friends,positive
basically theres family where little boy jake thinks theres zombie in his closet his parents are fighting all the timethis movie is slower than soap opera and suddenly jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombieok first of all when youre going to make film you must decide if its thriller or drama as drama the movie is watchable parents are divorcing arguing like in real life and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film expected to see boogeyman similar movie and instead watched drama with some meaningless thriller spots3 out of just for the well playing parents descent dialogs as for the shots with jake just ignore them,negative
petter matteis love in the time of money is visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us vivid portrait about human relations this is movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter this being variation on the arthur schnitzlers play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact stylishly the film has sophisticated luxurious look we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitatthe only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounterthe acting is good under mr matteis direction steve buscemi rosario dawson carol kane michael imperioli adrian grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alivewe wish mr mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work,positive
probably my alltime favorite movie story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to noble cause but its not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some or more times in the last years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressedup midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if had dozen thumbs theyd all be up for this movie,positive

this show was an amazing fresh innovative idea in the 70s when it first aired the first or years were brilliant but things dropped off after that by the show was not really funny anymore and its continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is todayits truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen the writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guesthosts this show probably wouldnt still be on the air find it so hard to believe that the same creator that handselected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity felt must give stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such huge success as it is now the show is just awful cant believe its still on the air,negative
encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake ive seen films and this is truly one of the worst of them its awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song lame country tune is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have been so happy to see the end credits of film the only thing that prevents me giving this 1score is harvey keitel while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only,negative

phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlinesat first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed didnt find the jokes or oddness funny anymoreits low budget film thats never problem in itself there were some pretty interesting characters but eventually just lost interesti imagine this film would appeal to stoner who is currently partakingfor something similar but better try brother from another planet,negative
saw this movie when was about when it came out recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air the horror the horroras young kid going to these cheesy films on saturday afternoons still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero beautiful woman who might be the daughter of professor and happy resolution when the monster died in the end didnt care much for the romantic angle as year old and the predictable plots love them now for the unintentional humorbut about year or so later saw psycho when it came out and loved that the star janet leigh was bumped off early in the film sat up and took notice at that point since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from wellworn formula there are no rules,negative
so im not big fan of bolls work but then again not many are enjoyed his movie postal maybe im the only one boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on tropical island should be warned that this is not far cry this is something mr boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks feeling loneley on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with these players go by the names of til schweiger udo kier and ralf moellerthree names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz so the tale goes like this jack carver played by til schweiger yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes however find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass people have complained about how hes not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in first person perspective so we dont really know what he looked like when he was kicking however the storyline in this film is beyond demented we see the evil mad scientist dr krieger played by udo kier making geneticallymutatedsoldiers or gms as they are called performing his topsecret research on an island that reminds me of spoiler vancouver for some reason thats right no palm trees here instead we got some nice rich lumberjackwoods we havent even gone far before started to cry mehehe cannot go on any more if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience meaning most of it will suckthere are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes until the whole cromedalbino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh the movie far cry reeks of scheisse thats poop for you simpletons from far if you wanna take wiff go ahead btw carver gets very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes hes on screen,negative
the cast played shakespeareshakespeare losti appreciate that this is trying to bring shakespeare to the masses but why ruin something so goodis it because the scottish play is my favorite shakespeare do not know what do know is that certain rev bowdler hence bowdlerization tried to do something similar in the victorian erain other words you cannot improve perfectioni have no more to write but as have to write at least ten lines of text and english composition was never my forte will just have to keep going and say that this movie as the saying goes just does not cut it,negative
this fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous one of the actors is george clooney and im not fan but this roll is not bad another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack the man of constant sorrow recommand this movie to everybody greetings bart,positive
kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film ive ever seen sort of like high school film project what was rosanna arquette thinking and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town pretty hard to get involved with this one no lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped nonsensewhat was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters and what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles give this one pass its like million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa,negative
some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not bad film but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the film of the same title liam neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in its attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in trade off for snazzier special effects again will say that in and of itself it is not bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more,positive
this movie made it into one of my top most awful movies horrible there wasnt continuous minute where there wasnt fight with one monster or another there was no chance for any character development they were too busy running from one sword fight to another had no emotional attachment except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies lotr star wars and matrix examplesthe ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda obee one and vader the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings elijah wood is the victim in both films and waitit hypnotizes stings its victim and wraps them upuh helloand the whole machine vs humans theme was the matrixor terminatorthere are more examples but why waste the time and will someone tell me what was with the nazis nazis there was juvenile story line rushed to juvenile conclusion the movie could not decide if it was childrens movie or an adult movie and wasnt much of either just awful real disappointment to say the least save your money,negative

an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe theyve taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that theyve taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but its simply bizarre by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for far better film so why did they come up with this dishwaterdull script suppose there werent enough naked people in the factual version its hurriedly capped off in the end with summary of the artists life we could have saved ourselves couple of hours if theyd favored the rest of the film with same brevity,negative
after the success of die hard and its sequels its no surprise really that in the 1990s glut of die hard on movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that is what they did with cliffhanger die hard on mountain just in time to rescue sly stop or my mom will shoot stallones careercliffhanger is one big nitpickers dream especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing basejumping aviation facial expressions acting skills all in all its full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk stallone even managed to get outacted by horse however if you an forget all the nonsense its actually very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills and unintentionally plenty of laughsyouve got to love john lithgows sneery evilness his tick every box band of baddies and best of all the permanently harassed and hapless turncoat agent rex linn as travershe may of been henry in portrait of serial killer but michael rooker is noteworthy for cringeworthy performance as hal he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors that man never hurt anybody and whilst he surely cant be it really does look like ralph waites frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her deathmention too must go to former londons burning actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy who comes cropper whilst using hal as human football yes you cant help enjoy that bit hal needed good kickingso forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy and if youre looking for qaulen hes the one wearing the helicopter,positive
had the terrible misfortune of having to view this bmovie in its entiretyall have to say is save your time and money this has got to be the worst bmovie of all time it shouldnt even be called bmovie more like an fmovie because it fails in all aspects that make good movie the story is not interesting at all all of the actors are paperthin and not at all believable it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake its almost funnyalmostthe movie is just packed full of crappy oneliners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bitthis movie is supposed to be geared towards men but all the women in it are so utterly unattractive especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end they try to appear sexy in those weird horrible costumes and they fail miserablyeven some of the most ridiculous bmovies will still give you some laughs but this is just too painful to watch,negative
what an absolutely stunning movie if you have hrs to kill watch it you wont regret it its too much fun rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isnt anything more other than him still liked it the music by arrehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it few times you really start liking it,positive
first of all lets get few things straight here am an anime fan always has been as matter of fact used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool do like several bmovies because theyre hilarious like the godzilla movies lotmoving on when the movie first comes on it seems like its going to be your usual bmovie down to the crappy fx but all sudden boom the anime comes on this is when the movie goes wwwaaaaayyyyy downhillthe animation is very bad cheap even worse than what remember from speed racer for crissakes in fact its so cheap one of the few scenes from the movie vividly remember is when bunch of kids run out of school its the same kids over over again the fx are terrible too the dinosaurs look worse than godzilla in addition the transition to live action to animation is unorganized the dialogue voicesespecially the english dub that viewed was horrid was begging my dad to take the tape out of the dvd vhs player the only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes comments like the robots joelmike on mst3k you pick the season honestly this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie survive it at the same timeheck im planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for bmovie night because its stupid pretty painful to watch unintentionally hilarious at the same time im giving this movie an improvement from the was originally going to give itaccording to my grading scale means pretty much both boring bad as fun as counting to three unless you find way to make fun of it then it will become as fun as counting to,negative
this was the worst movie saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film its great to see jbeals but shes only in the movie for few minutes mparker is much better actress than the part allowed for the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore bore to watch there is no real emotional depth to the story movie revolving about an actor who cant get work doesnt feel very original to me nor does the development of the cop it feels like one of many straighttovideo movies saw back in the 90s and not even good one in those standards,negative

the cell is an exotic masterpiece dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of serial killer but also into one of very talented director this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations this is boldness at work pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent this is the best movie of the year to dateive read numerous complaints about this film anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point this movie may be landmark tradition where future movies will hopefully follow the cell has just opened the door to another world of imagination so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director tarsem singh that we dont want any more personally would more than welcome another movie by tarsem and would love to see someone try to challenge himweve all heard talk about going inside the mind of serial killer and yes do agree that the genre is bit overworked the 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick some of them worked but most failed but the cell does not blaze down the same trail we are given new twist we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studiedi like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another instead she just lies down on laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity the cell wants to let you see what its all about and not how its all about and guess thats what some people dont like true do like explanations with my movies but when movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it ini noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another nonetheless the set design was simply astonishing wouldnt be surprised if this film took home few oscars in cinematography best costumes best director and the like if it were up to me itd at least get nominated for best pictureive noticed that ive kind of been repeating myself not because theres nothing else to say but because cant stress enough how fantastic thought the cell was if you walk into the movie with very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eyepopping feast then you are assured good time guess this film was just little too much for some people writing it off as weird or crazy am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind so it was right down my alley leaving the theater heard one audience member say whoever made that movie sure did lot of good drugs if so want what he was smoking out of,positive
this film tried to be too many things all at once stinging political satire hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family values promo the list goes on and on it failed miserably at all of them but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the endalthough appreciate the spirit behind war inc it depresses me to see such clumsy effort especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of serious critique rather than simply the poor writing direction and production of this particular filmthere is critique to be made about the corporatization of war but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening reminds me bit of three kings which similarly trivializes genuine cause for concern,negative
this movie was so frustrating everything seemed energetic and was totally prepared to have good time at least thought id be able to stand it but was wrong first the weird looping it was like watching americas funniest home videos the damn parents hated them so much the stereotypical latino family need to speak with the person responsible for this we need to have talk that little girl who was always hanging on someone just hated her and had to mention it now the final scene transcends must say its so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is movie of its own what crappy dancing horrible and beautiful at once,negative
war movie is hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue rehashed plot and overthetop action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with largescale combat once in while however war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen the civil warera cold mountain starring jude law nicole kidman and renée zellweger is such filmthen again calling cold mountain war movie is not entirely accurate true enough the film opens with quite literally quickanddirty battle sequence that puts glory director edward zwick shame however cold mountain is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman played by jude law who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind ada monroe played by nicole kidman at first glance this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldiers tribulations on the battlefield indeed the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrivedcold mountain soon takes drastic turn though as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be deserter incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates and begins long odyssey homeward meanwhile back at the farm adas cultured ways prove of little use in the fields soon she is transformed into something of wilderbeast coming to adas rescue is the course toughasnails ruby thewes played by renée zellweger who helps ada put the farm back together and perhaps more importantly cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon adawithin these two settings vivid compelling and at times very disturbing portrait of the wartorn south unfolds the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as rubys deadbeat father ray winstone as an unrepentant southern lawman and natalie portman as deeply troubled and isolated young mother all have been greatly affected and changed by the war of northern aggression mostly for the worse the dark pervading antiwar message accented by an effective haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century its hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevantdirector anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film though the inherently distant abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plotmake no mistake cold mountain has neither the traits of feelgood romance nor an inspiring war drama it is unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of people torn apart by war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether,positive

my first exposure to the templarios not good one was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video which has brought us other cult classics such as spider baby the print quality is excellent but this alone cant hide the fact that the film is deadly dull theres thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact terrible revenge on the templars set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow ponderous ultimately unfulfilling adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket,negative
one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist the mafia middleman titta di girolamo physically nondescript middleaged man originally from salerno in southern italy when were introduced to him at the start of the film hes been living nonlife in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italianspeaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years conducting business we are only gradually introduced to while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamos cash tell him that dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes at the news he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account meanwhile he tells us the spectators that when you bluff you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous he says you cant bluff for while and then halfway through tell the truth having eventually done this bluffed only halfway through and told the truth and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately love is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamos troubles this initially unsympathetic character scowling taciturn curt man on the verge of man who wont even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about at one point in his nonlife titta decides to feel concern about appearing ridiculous the first half of the film may be described as slow by some it does indeed reveal di girolamos days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined deliberate pace revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details however scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes the existence of titta di girolamo the man with no imagination identity or life the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dellamore or limbalsamatore another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonists insomnia not unlike the machinist and in far more explicit way the al pacino film insomnia le conseguenze dellamore uses this condition to symbolise deeper emotional malaise thats been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious its almost impossible to pinpoint its cause if indeed there is one the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia played by olivia magnani granddaughter of the legendary anna and the memory of tittas best friend man whom he hasnt seen in years unexpectedly provide tiny window onto life that titta eventually though tentatively at first accepts to look through again though its never explicitly spelt out the spectator knows that to man like titta accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences film without single scene of sex or violence film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectators expectations le conseguenze dellamore is fine representative of that small quiet discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecittà during the second half of the 70s the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postinolike fare more la vita bellastyle films neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dellamore limbalsamatore and others your loss world,positive
watched this film not really expecting much got it in pack of films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under fiver so what could expect and you know what was right they were all terrible this movie has few and few is stretching it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is nice touch the drummer is very like drummer ie damned annoying and well thats about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what can only assume was an attempt to build tension whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking coz they dont half mention how beautiful he is hell of lot thought he looked bit like meercat all this and havent even mentioned the killer im not even gonna go into it its just not worth explaining anyway as far as im concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who was actually quite funny it wasnt because of their acting talent ive certainly seen lot worse but ive also seen lot better best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry,negative
bought this film at blockbuster for because it sounded interesting bit ranmaesque with the idea of someone dragging around skeleton because there was cute girl in miniskirt on the back and because there was restricted viewing sticker on it thought it was going to be sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with weird indie edge was wronghaving watched it have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker since there is hardly any foul language little violence and the closest thing to nudity honestly dont usually go around hoping for it is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties you see her panties lot in this movie because no matter what shes wearing miniskirt of some sort even the antireligious humor is tame and lame caricatured insincere derivative unoriginal and worst of all not funny in the slightestit would be better just to listen to ray stevens would jesus wear rolex on his television show this would barely qualify as pg13 it is not rated but blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of rent thisas if it was pornographic any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for dream but they insist that zack and reba is worseit is but not in that wayin way this worries methe only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning if anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides not this one but better ones like the virgin suicides its teenagers if both of those movies were rated purely because of the suicide aspect then have little chance of turning story ive been writing into pg13 movie the main characters are eleven and half and twelve suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers think its number so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by itjust say no to this movie though,negative
the plot is about the death of little children hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter in the end the serial killer get caught thats it but before you find out who dunnit you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors it is unbelievable how bad these actors are including hopper could go on like this but that to much of waste of my time just dont watch the movie ive warned you,negative
ever watched movie that lost the plot well this didnt even really have one to begin withwhere to begin the achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms that are strangely never actually heard in the housegreat double glazing the house that is apparently only few miles from town yet is several hours walk away or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable or even the beginning which suggests spate of killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house or the bizarre ritual with the salt pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of directionadd lead actress who cant act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty but not in the way you hopegiven following simply for being banned in the uk in the 80s mostly because of final surprisingly over extended murder it offers nothing but curiosity value and one classic daft murder dont worryits telegraphed at least ten minutes beforeafter walk in the woods our victim comes to rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up halfway through they see figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing large scythe what do they do slide down and run like the rest of us no of course not they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weaponit really is only movie as they say,negative
okay so this series kind of takes the route of here we go again week in week out david morses character helps out his ride who is in bit of pickle but whats wrong with that david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there and certainly the coolest and to have him in series created by david koepp great writer is heavendue to the lack of love for this show by many cant see it going to season series but you never know the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me lets hope something good can make it past first series,positive
after sitting through this pile of dung my husband and wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether computer program could produce movie it was that listless and formulaic but the us propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film provesdisappointinglythat its the work of humans call me conspiracy theorist but quotes like we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq etc the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like would never use the declaration of independence as bargaining chip with straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene the reasoning behind each plot turn and new clue is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow and theres also bonus side plot of misogyny with dr whateverhernamewas being chided by all involved for never shutting up shes clearly in the movie only for looks but they felt the need to slap dr title on her character to give her some gravity at one point cages character says dont you ever shut up and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands like shes child truly grotesque the only benefit to this movie was that its so astonishingly bad you do get few laughs out of it the really scary thing is that majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it creepy,negative
it had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie felt like sucker for watching it the production was good however the script and acting were bmovie quality the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors the good actors didnt hold their own nor did they lift up the others this movie is not worthy of more words but will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines james wood and cuba gooding jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies if you are looking for mindless entertainment still wouldnt recommend this movie,negative
this movie is based on the book many splendored thing by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites topic that comes from hans personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china that background and the beautiful hong kong settings gives this love story unique and rather daring atmosphere for its timeother than that the story is stereotypical romance with memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself the beautiful jennifer jones looks the part and gives wonderful oscar nominated performance as doctor of mixed breed during the advent of communism in mainland china william holden never looked better playing romantic lead as journalist covering war torn regions in the world the acting is top notch and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclinedthe cinematography really brings out fiftys hong kong especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments the ending is real tearjerker some may consider sentimental romances passé but for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories this is shining example,positive
of all the films have seen this one the rage has got to be one of the worst yet the direction logic continuity changes in plotscript and dialog made me cry out in pain how could anyone come up with something so crappy gary busey is know for his movies but this is sure movie wwastetake for example about two dozen fbi local law officers surround trailer house with jeep wagoneer inside the jeep is ma and is confused as to why all the cops are about within seconds huge gun battle ensues ma being killed straight off the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bulletpellet ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticeddamn that guy is tough truly miracle not since the sixshooter held bullets has there been such miracle,negative
had heard good things about states of grace and came in with an open mind thought that gods army was okay and thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as filmmaker the film began with some shaky acting and thought well maybe it will get better unfortunately it never did the picture starts out by introducing two elders mormon missionaries and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them instead the story degenerates into highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays and it becomes almost laughabledutchers only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience by unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of mormon missionaries dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly mormon audience the film in no way reflects reality missions are nothing like what dutcher shows having served mormon mission myself can attest to this fact and gang life in california certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgaritythe conclusion which im assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable cmon the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other and cheesy next time dutcher try making movie that someone can identify with,negative
this movie struck home for me being remember the 80s and my father working in factory figured if worked hard too if had pride and never gave up too could have the american dream the house few kids car all to call my own ive noted however without degree in something unlike my father that quit at ninth grade and keen sense of greed and laziness you cant get anywherei would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs its made for tv and just saw it an hour ago ic ant find it anywhere id love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon time americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished think the feeling is still there but in heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas,positive
as disclaimer ive seen the movie times in the last years and only just saw the musical this week this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasnt in the musical however it tainted me when watched the musical actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role along with kasey think her let me dance for you scene is one of the best parts of the movie worthwhile addition compared to the musical the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical as well as the cast which is at least times bigger easier to do in the movie of course the decors lighting dancing and singing are also much superior in the movie which should be expected and was indeed delivered the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to musical which has few decors the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical,positive
protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with good cast of supporting actors the story revolves around ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldies charm just doesnt save this movie unless you are goldie hawn fan dont go out of your way to see this film,negative
how this film could be classified as drama have no idea if were john voight and mary steenburgen would be trying to erase this from my cv it was as historically accurate as xena and hercules abraham and moses got melded into noah lot abrahams nephew lot turns up thousands of years before he would have been born canaanites wandered the earthreally what were the scriptwriters thinking was it just ignorance remember something about noah and animals and lot and canaanites and all that stuff from sunday school or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible from christians jews and muslims to historians archaeologists geologists psychologists linguists as matter of fact did anyone not get offended anyone who had even modicum of taste would have winced at this one,negative
preston sturgis the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kaels the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis screenplay here as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site kael overstated her casethere are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane the newsreel representing ralston the henry luce clone thatchers memoirs bernstein jed leland susan alexander kane and raymond the butler each has his or her different slant on kane reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kanes story this method also leads to frequent overlapping retellings of the same incidentthis is not the situation in the power and the glory yes like kane it is about legendary business leader here it is tom garner spencer tracy man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country but there are only two narrators they are garners right hand man henry ralph morgan and his wife sarah padden this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner henry when he narrates is talking about his boss and friend whom he respected and loved his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public she sees only the flaws in henrytypical example although he worked his way up tom becomes more and more antilabor in his later years unions are troublemakers and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans henry describes toms confrontation with the union in major walkout and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life but henrys wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike apparently blowing up the unions headquarters killing many people so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure blackim not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kanes success few films do including all of orson welles other films but am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold ones interest to the end and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought homewhen they marry tom wants to do well in part to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had but in america great business success comes at cost tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire he expands it and improves it constantly but it takes him away from home too much and he loses touch with sally and he also notices eve helen vinson the younger woman who becomes his mistress when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys hersimilarly tom too gets full shock which makes him martyr in the eyes of henry eve marries tom and presents him with son but it turns out to be eves son by toms son tom jr philip trent the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himselfthe film is not total success the action jumps at times unconvincingly yet it does make the business seem real note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase small rival train line and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans sturgis came from wealthy background so he could bring in this type of detail so on the whole it is first rate film no citizen kane perhaps but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america,positive

return to the 36th chamber is one of those classic kungfu movies which shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood and the protagonist gordon liu the counterpart to the westerns clint eastwood digitally remastered and new print made for the fantastic film fest this is presented in shaw scope just like the good old daysthis film is simple story of good versus evil told in acts which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that eraact one sets up the premise workers in dyemill of small village are unhappy with their lot having their wages cut by by incoming manchu gangsters they cant do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters and their boss at first they had minor success in getting liu to impersonate highly skilled shaolin monk one of the best comedy sequences but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many timesact two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob however without real martial arts he embarks on journey to shaolin temple to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly after some slapstick moments he finally gets accepted by the abbot whom he impersonated but is disappointed at the teaching methods kinda like mr miyagis style in karate kid but instead of painting fences he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple nothing can keep good man down and he unwittingly builds strength endurance and learns kungfu the unorthodox wayact three is where the fight fest begins with cheesy sound effects each obvious noncontact on film is given the maximum impact treatment but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners and the use of slowmotion only to showcase stunts in different angles you may find the speed of fights tad too slow with some pause in between moves but with yuen wo ping and his style being used adnausem in hollywood flicks they sure dont make fight scenes like they used to return to the 36th chamber gets repeat screening on monday so if youre game for nostalgic trip down memory lane what are you waiting for,positive

as someone has already mentioned on this board its very difficult to make fake documentary it requires tremendous skill pacing patience directorial distance plausible premise narrative flow and really believable acting aka great acting such is not the case with love machine it starts to show its faux hand about the 20minute mark with minutes left to watch and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in its downhill from theredirector gordon eriksen simply peaked too soon but to be fair to eriksen his problems started early as he explains in the extras he began wanting to do real doc couldnt get funding and settled for cheaper way of making his filmthe premise people who have secret lives by posting themselves on porn website was perhaps more interesting in when the film was made eriksen does lot of tricky stuff pushy host handheld cameras zooms grainy blacks and whites all guess to elicit sense of authenticity but it just doesnt work the film is confusing and forced but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue,negative
the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more of course its not going to be an oscar nominated film its just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for minutesthe plot is basically about group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert its just them fighting back throughout the whole film which includes lot of violence which is basically the whole film as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audienceid give the hills have eyes ii out of for pure entertainment and that only although even then found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment something to pass time if youre bored and nothing else410,negative

just watched the dresser this evening having only seen it once before about dozen years agoits not big movie and doesnt try to make big splash but my god the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this moviethe dresser is the story of sir an aging shakespearean actor finney and his dresser norman courtenay sort of valet putting on production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii these are two men each dependent upon the other sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole wheedle and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of lear and norman lives his life vicariously through sir without sir to need him he is nothing or thinks he is anywaythis is characterdriven film the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life finney only years old is completely believable as very old very sick petulant bullying but brilliant stage actor he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when theyre taking their bows and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser who must sometimes act more as mother than as valet to his elderly employer employer is really the wrong term to use though for although technically their relationship is that of employer and employee most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married coupleyes there are others in the cast of this movie but there is no question that the true stars are finney courtenay and the marvelous script by ronald harwood that is not to say that there arent other fine performances most notably eileen atkins as the longsuffering stage manager madge there is wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires old regrets and what might have beenalthough it doesnt get talked about these days it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay best picture best director peter yates and best adapted screenplayi had remembered this as being good movie but wasnt prepared to be as completely mesmerized as was from beginning to end if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about and be hugely entertained all the while then encourage you to see the dresser,positive
what happened what we have here is basically solid and plausible premise and with decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it actually it never really got going there was little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it steve martin who is very talented person and usually brings lot to movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters kate and angie and maybe try not for pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe drama with comedic elements think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here can think of numerous scenarios that would have been riot,negative
ive just watched fingersmith and im stunned to see the average rating for the shownot only was the plot was difficult to follow but it seems character development was randomly appliedthe actors were adequate but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional once this happens the story really falls flat and becomes tediousand just in case anyone didnt see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the filmthe end scene is disappointing and phoned in and anyone who sat back and went ohhh so they were carpet munchers all along must have been out for the eveningtwo stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least bit raunchy none for the rest of it,negative

dont torture duckling is one of fulcis earlier and honestly in terms of storyline better films and although not the typical bloodbath that fulci is known for this is still very unique and enjoyable filmthe story surrounds small town where series of child murders are occurring some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations either as suspects or those helping the investigation or in some cases both include the towns police force smalltime reporter beautiful and rich exdrug addict young priest and his mother an old man who practices witchcraft and his female protégé mentally handicapped townsman and deafmute little girl all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns until the actual killer is revealeddont torture duckling is neither classical giallo or typical fulci gore film although it does contain elements of both it is more of an oldfashioned murder mystery with darker subject matter and few scenes of graphic violence although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulcis later works this is well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end recommended for giallomurdermystery fans or anyone looking to check out some of fulcis nonsplatter films but dont despair dont torture still has more than its fair share of violence and sleaze some may be put off by the subject of the child killings and one main female character has strange habit of hitting on very young boys which is also kind of disconcerting but if that type of material doesnt bother you then definitely give this one look,positive

really like salman kahn so was really disappointed when seen this movie it didnt have much of plot and what they did have was not that appealing salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this dvd the music was not bad it was quite nice usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was very short movie for an indian film the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes ali larter her acting had lot to be desired however she did look good in the indian dresses that she wore all the movie had not lot to be desired and hope salman does lot better on his next movie thank you,negative
im not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is sequel to the first three movieswhich it is not even though marques houston did appear in hp3 he played totally different character he was eight years older in this film okayso reid and martin werent the most talented and couldnt carry film all by themselvesbut to trade on the hp franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference albeit minor to the earlier movies im sure everyone who wanted to see it was hoodwinkedinto thinking that they were seeing sequelnot totally different film with familiar name and im sorrykym whitley is not funny and could not hold candle to the late robin harris ketty lester or dc curry in the earlier films although meagen good and mari morrow are substantial visual diversioni have to give this thumbs down just naming the film down to the last minute would have been ok furthermore the hudlin brothers who produced the first three movies were not involved in the making of this film,negative
this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen the writer obviously bought the playbook how to write space disaster movie and followed it play by play in particular the stereotypical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space putting on brave show in the face of disaster has been done time and time againmax appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw million at the project but judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects the producers could only muster thousand to learn that the film was nominated for special visual effects emmy has me absolutely gobsmackedi think handful of high school students with pass in media studies could have created more believable effectsand the plot holes are too numerous to mention but will pick one out as an example now im no nasa expert but surely its highly implausible that worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold position of power in the control room when things start to go pearshaped with the program surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than twentynine year old who has not been in the control room beforethe only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell he manages to make good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this scripti give this film out of with the aboveaverage work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from lower mark,negative
caddyshack two is good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up robert stack is horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield ty webb is funny being the only character from the original most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original henry wilcoxon for example except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt being played by randy quaid every line he says reminds me of the originals humor especially the scene at his office dont go in for law suits or motions find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with fing baseball bat make bonfire with the chippindalemaybe roast that golden retriever arff arff arff then eat it and then im comin upstairs junior and im grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight do we have an understanding offsetting his small role however is dan acroyd who is obviously no replacement for bill murray his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny its just stupid overall caddyshack ii is good movie but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it,negative
honestly this short film sucks the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience the unearthed dvd is crisp and clear and havent made up my mind if this helps or hinders it if the film was little grainy it might have added some creepiness factor to what was going on have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like nekromantik and visitor among others are more shocking than in aftermath all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull this is an expensive beautifully filmed turd its not that shocking its not that disgusting if you insist on viewing it rent it give it for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia there should definitely be bigger selection for us sickos the filming is good and it does have some gore if watching rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore but other than that absolutely nothing going for this overhyped mess on the other hand genesis cerdas sequel to aftermath now available as double feature released by unearthed films is an absolute masterpiece of short film really showing what good director cerda really is when given the right material although dont care for aftermath at all genesis is so well made that will forgive cerda and definitely keep an eye out for him in the future,negative
thought that mukhsin has been wonderfully written its not just about entertainment theres tonnes of subtle messages that think yasmin was trying to bring across and yes it might be confusing to some of youespecially if you didnt watch sepet andor gubra for timesi bet noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right its really ironic how the characters relate like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gubra and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future and absolutely love the voiceovers its crude yet awakeningly fresh like when they took shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard then there was suddenly mukhsins voice saying bismillahhirrahmannirrahim the scene when he climbed the treeit captured malaysians attitudeand in some mild way sniggering at how pathetic it is portrayed in the character for example even the kids can be really sharp tonguedcomplete with the shrill annoying voice and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long and how you can be such busybody and talk about ppl when ur own life isnt sorted out all can say is this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it it kept me glued to the screen couldnt even take my eyes off it not even to make out in the cinema ha ha,positive

it tries to be the epic adventure of the century and with cast like shô kasugi christopher lee and johnrhys davies it really is the perfect badventure of all time its actually is pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with its flaws captures your interest it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it even if its made in the 90s it doesnt have modern feel it more has the same feeling that old errol flynn movie had big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but im afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had this on the other hand just has the real feeling you just cant hate it think its an okay adventure movie and really love the soundtrack damn want the theme song,positive

maybe it was the title or the trailer certainly not the interview on the dvd which is with the director as he keeps saying hi kids into the camera like buffoon but had expectations for entrails of virgin to be at least bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal bloody killings by weird japanese penetrator turns out its way too sleazy for its own good or bad or whatever theres problem and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust similar to this in many respects in not having balance to the sex and violence too much sex and it will turn into prototypical porno and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies and with the killing scenes there has to be at least little tack and maybe just smidgen of ingenuity in creating the creaturekillerwhatever entrails of virgin has neither its safe to say its pretty soulless movie even if isnt one of the very worst ever made its there just for horndog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their other headsin this case were given photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls nothing too salacious and then by way of dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by murderer as hes credited first off the director kazuo gaira komizu decides he has to put in quota of random sex scenes early on we get spliced in or phoned in take your pick clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere it looks like its from another movie then once settled into the house theres wrestling scene thats poorly choreographed and shot yeah we really need to see him all there and then on to the rape and killings first the rape by the photographers who promise the girls some jobs for their time then the murderer who like damatos creature is simply covered in mud and given stupid facial and who for an unknown reason kills the men andor rapes the women one by onenow the latter of those taken by themselves should be considered the highlights of the movie this is like saying however that the croûtons are the best part of wretchedly tasting salad an eyegouging scene spike thrown like an olympic event that scene actually is kind of cool and finally the entrailing of the overly sexcrazed girl whose inconsequential name cant remember even this becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title on top of this the sex scenes which become tedious through gaira and his indulgence in longtakeswithoutcutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway are dubbed over by the actors youd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough hence the need to let them speak for themselves but the overall feeling from entrails of virgin is that of lumpy one where its just there to be gawked at and without shred of suspense or true horror watch as the last girl left alive the virgin of the picture tries to stop the murderer from getting to her which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him you just want it to be done with for the hate women mantra to ease up or be rid altogether,negative

this film took me by surprise make it habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler all knew upon entering the theater is that it was documentary about long married couple and that imdb readers gave it rotten tomatoes users ranked it at and the critics averaged an amazing if anything they underrated this little gemfilmmaker doug block decided to record his parents for posterity and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents outspoken mother mina and less than forthcoming dad mike immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker mike minas son doug was going to take us as matter of fact doubt that doug himself knew where he was going with thislife takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey it is difficult to verbalize just how moved was with this story and the unique way in which it was told absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is mustsee even if you arent fan of the documentary genre this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten birch street is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes deep impression and never leaves you the best news of all is that hbo had hand in the production so instead of playing to limited art house audience eventually millions of people will have chance to view this incredible piece of work bravo,positive

fate leads walter sparrow to come in possession of mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life all based around the number as the story unfolds in real life and fiction sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually endthe number offers an intriguing premise that is undone by weak execution the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential the screenplay was probably the worst part about it it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie it seemed like the screenwriter had good idea he just didnt know how to develop it to stretch over ninety minute running time the second half of the film was running low on ideas the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awfuljoel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself little with phone booth and few other films but the number reminds me that hes still capable of making stinker he has the movie drenched in style but he just cant get good focus he moves the film at clunky and slow pace he switches from reality to whats actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying the actual book in the film thats titled the number is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears when carrey is finally done with book we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery at this point the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension we impatiently wait for the movie to reach its horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finishedthe acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didnt even seem to be trying he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden his narration was complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character virginia madsen did the best she could with limited role but she needs to pick better scripts logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston overall the number was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills rating,negative

if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to with conversation character and simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new better and different those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing directing and acting that melds into wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england other days other times funneled into terrific comedy of entertainment made in with alfred molina joan plowright polly walker josie lawrence jim broadbent miranda richardson and michael kitchens in the major roles under the brush stroke direction of mike newell these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with sublimely subtle painters eye reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century this film might be called friendship farce that becomes worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character and the viewer too an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us,positive

my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts and thus at least quarter longer because otherwise how can one explain its confused abbreviated storyline was never completely lost but was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slotif it were longer it might make more sense but it still wouldnt be much good the movies most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being war between the male and female but the movie drops the ball on this making heras followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what zeus followers do or believe the movie is also interesting because you dont see the gods and theres no real certainty that they exist so its got couple of intriguing ideas but it doesnt do anything useful with thembad dialog cardboard characters and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons not unwatchable but also not worth watching,negative

this is the worst movie have ever seen as well as the worst that will probably ever see see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously just be forewarnedthis is not one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it its just plain bad bad bad bad badthis movie is the equivalent to having pet rock as your friend you wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen unfortunately it never does at least with pet rock you knew what you were getting into lions gate completely deceives on this bombshell nothis is disaster after watching this film you would swear george bush had his hands all over the making of this film yes its that idioticstay away unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time its probably how lions gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe,negative
have been mario fan for as long as can remember have very fond memories of playing super mario world as kid this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in spacethe story begins much like any other mario game mario receives letter from princess peach inviting him to celebration at her castle in the mushroom kingdom upon arriving at peachs castle mario finds bowser and his son bowser jr attacking the castle with their airships bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lifts her castle up into space in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet mario is found by talking star named luma and is taken back to the lumas home floating space station here mario meets many other lumas and also meets their leader woman named rosalina rosalina tells mario that bowser has taken away the space stations power stars and scattered them across the universe it is up to mario to help the lumas find them and save peach thus the adventure beginsthe way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity some planets are small and others are big many planets are similar to classic mario environments the best thing about the game are the controls all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game you shake the remote mario will perform spin that is used as the primary attack in the game and it will as well activate the shooting stars you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment then there is the graphics these are by far the best graphics on the wii it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks you could probably almost say it looks as good as some gamesmy only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to and also the story is pretty weak the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at lives still these minor problems aside its superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging this is the type of game that weve been waiting for on the wiia perfect out of,positive
this short film that inspired the soontobe full length feature spatula madness is hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers the short film stars edward the spatula who after being fired from his job joins in the fight against the evil spoons this premise allows for some funny content near the beginning but is barely present for the remainder of the feature this films 15minute running time is absorbed by some oddball comedy and small musical number unfortunately not much else lies below it the plot that is set up doesnt really have time to show but its surely follows it plot better than many highbudget hollywood films this film is worth watching at least few times take it for what it is and dont expect deep story,positive
okay last night august 18th had the distinct displeasure of meeting mr van bebble at showing of the film the manson family at the three penny in chicago as part of the chicago underground film festival heres what have to say about it first of all the film is an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger roman polanski oliver stone and terry gilliam movie ive ever seen second of all in short session after the show mr van bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual manson family members or charlie himself calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them that the film was based on his van bebbles take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on tv and in the news and im assuming from the autobiography and the book helter skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative so had second dibs on questions asked if he was trying to present the outsider mtv sex drugs and rock roll version and not necessarily the true story this question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting you shut the up this is the truth all those other movies are bullshwell anyway didnt even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when read the tagline for the film youve heard the laws side of the storynow hear the story as it is told by the manson family excuse me if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesnt want to have anything to do with how in gods name can he tell the story for them this is the most ridiculous statement have ever heard the film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small dimly lit theatre and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock roll mind of man who couldnt even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky horroresque call line to the actors on screen this film accomplishes little more than warping the publics image of actual events which helped shape the state of america and much of the world today into some sort of slashercomic bookpornorape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individualthe film was definitely very impressive to look at the soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of charlies work with the family off of his lie album the editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos all in all this film would have made much better addition to the catalogues at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers felt like was at midnight rocky horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving probably the best part of the experience the cast was very good with the exception of charlie who resembled some sort of stoned dungeons and dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying the descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow lethargic and chubby representation that was actually presentedall in all the film basically explains itself as sadie or maybe it was linda declares at the end you can write bunch of bullsh books or make bunch of bullsh moviesetc etc case in point even the disclaimer based on true story is dead giveaway signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made difference in the world all you have to do is little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap or actually maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read book insteadall can say is this when the film ended got free beer so im glad went but not so glad spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the up for asking the director question peace,negative
bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart am glad did it was very entertaining listening to sean connery and playing the game thought the graphics were the best have ever seen in moviegame remake the bonus levels were very hard the sniper one think was too hard it made me so frustrated didnt play the game for week and half there were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it the only thing might change was the upgrade system didnt notice any difference from unupgraded equipment to the upgraded such as buying an armor upgrade didnt seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter really liked the copter think the developers did good job,positive

it is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen and who will die it is about women and man who on vacation this was made during the end of the ultra nazi seventies when blonde women were supposedly ultra american survivors and brunettes were all deserving of deaththis movie like the others of that era contrives to bring this about and the viewer knows this there is no mystery or suspense the people squabble but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time it is laughablethe five people happen upon two savage young characters and go nuts everyone is nuts so that the directorwriter team can justify their nazi propagandafor some reason the guy is attracted to the blonde who is really not much to look at and ignores super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over one must remember that in the seventies movies were meant to appeal to women and not mentotally crap and totally depressing,negative
marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy show people released by mgm in davies plays hick from savannah georgia who arrives in hollywood with her father dell henderson the jalopy they arrive in is hoot as is davies outrageous southern costume davies lands job in slapstick comedy not what she wants but it brings her success she meets fellow slapstick star william haines who is immediately smitten with her well davies then gets job at more prestigious studio high art studios and lands job in stuffy period pieces handsome but fake actor andre telefair shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life but of course learns that is not who she really is marion davies is wonderful throughout as she outrageously runs the gamut of emotions required of serious actress william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self and there are cameos by charles chaplin john gilbert and other famous stars of the day including the director of the film king vidor this is silent film with few sound effects as sound pictures were just coming into their own treasure of film,positive
the performance of every actor and actress in the film are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that am never tired of seeing it over and over again however am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and director attenboroughs credits that puzzles me arent they proud of making claim that they have made such excellent long lasting film for the audience am hoping would get some answers to my puzzles from some one possibly one of the knowledgeable personnel insider of the film,positive
while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring star trek the final frontier is plain bad in this terrible sequel the crew is on shore leave when they get distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth romulus and kronos the klingon home world have been kidnapped by renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain starship to venture into the great barrier there he hopes to find god using mysticism and bad writing he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get hold of the ship they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find planet where they do meet godlike alien this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin at the core is good idea that is never really developed the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco the action scenes dont have the suspense of wrath of kahn the philosophy is boring and the humor is stale now will focus most of my anger on william shatner when he takes the directors chair the ego gets bigger most of the focus is on him spock and mccoy but does not give the others enough to do moreover whereas shatner is usually guilty of overacting in previous movies and television spots he is just plain bad in this one now kirk is reckless practical jokers and silly one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song row row row your boat in round by campfire in any case this is the worst of the star trek franchise should have given it three out of ten instead of five,negative
despite later claims this earlytalkie melodrama has very little in common with citizen kane its biopic of ruthless but human fictional plutocrat told in flashback but hopping around time the scriptwriter preston sturges shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of kane are evident still its very watchable with young spencer tracy his oldman makeup makes him look just like well an old spencer tracy showing depth and authority and colleen moore little past her prime and not physically well matched playing multifaceted womanbehindtheman theres also helen vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history sending the final third into ecstatic soapopera reverberations the surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets and there are some plot holes left open how would she know whose son it was if shes sleeping with both of them and the music is awfully hokey for all that was quite fascinated,positive
this is the best version so far that you will see and the most true to the bronte work dalton is little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared not handsome but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark pretty as she is is also complete and believable jane eyre this production is lengthy watch but well worth it nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true romance in literature this is the way to see it own every copy of this movie and have read and reread the original the filming may seem little dated now but there will never be another like this,positive
apparently the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this socalled movie they described blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence saw no intrigue instead saw miserable attempt at dialogue in supposed kung fu movie saw no violence at least saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt man with impervious skinbut here am perhaps revealing too much of the plot furthermore as viewer of many and sundry films some of which include the occasional kung fu movie can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable whatever you may choose to do will always remain correct jonathan tanner ps was not blinded by the choreography,negative
liked boyles performance but thats about the only positive thing can say everything was overdone to the point of absurdity most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9yearold nephew to speak if he were pretending to be jaded stonehearted cop or an ultraevil villain the raspy voiceovers seemed amateurish to me could go buy cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music and whats with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff it was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story cox added lot of things in fact that he apparently thought would be really cool but had nothing to do with the story thats big disappointment because one of the things that makes borges stories so good is his minimalism they are tightly bound with no superfluous details this movie is just the opposite stopped watching after the scene where lonnrot is questioning the guy from the yidische zaitung or thereabouts wasted renting this but at least can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake,negative

the assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character rather than star turns the need to stage special effects obligatory romance and endless car chases however there is car chase in here and dandy it is aidan quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer recruited to eliminate him it is rare that second or third tier actor such as quinn is given an important starring role like this that carries film usually such role is given to an alist actor with box office draw which is probably why never heard of this film before saw it donald sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous somewhat creepy at times agent that recruits quinn ben kingsley is fine also as the israeli agent the plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines which converge in gradual fashion toward the end and not all at once as were used to seeing the paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity the locations are convincing and effective the soundtrack is nothing special but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days without dumb andor meaningless plot developments unconvincing star turns loud annoying music video type soundtracks villain that hams it up and repeatedly cast costumes and plot that cater mostly to an audience under this is an outstanding thriller which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release of stars,positive

set in the the second year of the french republic formed after the execution of louis xvi this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders danton gerard depardieu at his finest and robespierre commanding performance by the polish actor wojciech pszoniak the moderate revolutionary danton has returned to paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the committee of public safety in the previous year by robespierre he is opposed to the reign of terror which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens mainly by guillotine who are thought to be opposed to the revolution danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade robespierre to curb the bloodletting but robespierre and the committee are afraid that the popularity of danton will lead to them being overthrown and put danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors this was the first french language film made by andrzej wajda after he had arrived in france from poland his polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the solidarity trade union which had opposed the polish government in the late seventies and early eighties his previous film man of iron had dealt with the solidarity union and its leader lech walesa and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of walesa and the polish leader general jaruselski and that between danton and robespierre dantonwalesa are the voice of reason opposed to robespierrejaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent the film is based on the polish play the danton affair written by stanislawa przybyszewska in the 1930s and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical but what the film does is to concentrate on the behindthescenes meetings of the committees and the scenes in the national assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of paris,positive

have now seen quite few films by pedro almodóvar but this would have to be the most disappointing so far this film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films and the story just never got me interested many almodóvar regulars appear in this film so its not like there was lack of onscreen talent but this film just seemed more serious than his other films if there was comedic edge to this movie certainly couldnt find it and it made for one surprisingly weak movie,negative
greatly enjoyed margaret atwoods novel the robber bride and was thrilled to see there was movie version woman frames cop boyfriend for her own murder and his buddy an excop journalist tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead womans crazy female friends its fortunate that the movie script fixes ms atwoods clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men victims of scheming womenheh okay you got me if these guys are mentioned in the book and im pretty sure theyre entirely made up for the movie ill eat the dust cover of my hardback copy apparently the three main female characters of the novel arent enough to carry the movie zenias manipulations arent interesting unless we see them happen to man and mans life is screwed up roz charis and toni tell their stories to man because its not important if man doesnt hear themi liked the characters in the book it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for mans story normally do not look for feminist angles on media and tried to enjoy the movie as is if hadnt read the book might have enjoyed the movie lot more so if you like the cop and the excop and you want to read more about them youre out of luck read the novel if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through plot its the same plot the movie excavated it ironed it and sprinkled it with male angst its like zenias revenge on margaret atwood,negative

ingrid bergman playing dentist walter matthaus faithful receptionist who harbors little crush on her boss is absolutely wonderful in this film she handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals terrific scene where she and goldie hawn talk in record booth ingrids monologue is front but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart matthau is an odd choice for the leading man hes too old for goldie hawn and too unrefined for bergman not to mention too unfocused to be dentist but liked the way he tries hard to please goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from lie hawn who won supporting oscar is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today this bedroom farce isnt terribly sophisticated and faintly reminds one of any wednesday besides but its welcome relief from the noisy teenoriented comedies they turn out today cactus flower is lovely sigh from,positive

ah yes the 1980s time of reaganomics and sly chuck and host of other action stars hiding in remote jungle blowing away commies at the time couldnt believe how movies like rambo missing in action and uncommon valor and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn made money at the box office theyre turgid action crap fests with rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly tromas war is tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but youve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place of course not tromas war lacks any sort of sophistication though it does make the point that theres no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones and sometimes feels more like grade movie than send up maybe it is,negative
this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces the fall of the house of usher dance of death poem is actually quite creepy from beginning to end it is similar to some of the old blackandwhite movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house for example the cat and the canary the old dark house night of terror and so on boris karloff plays demented inventor of lifesize dolls that terrorize the guests he dies early in the film or does he and the residents of the house are subjected to number of terrifying experiences wont go into too much detail here but it is definitely mustsee for fans of old dark house mysterieswatch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in darkened roomdan basinger,positive

revolt of the zombies proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea doesnt necessarily make lightning strike twicethe halperin brothers responsible for the horror classic white zombie made this trite piece of garbage mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled closeups of lugosis eyes from that previous film there was court battle with the white zombie films rights owners who didnt want the halperins to be able to use the word zombie in this title that word was the only thing that could help this film because as everyone knows bad films can make much more money simply by having the word zombie appear in the title knowing what victor halperin was capable of few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting it seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle the zombies here seem not to be true walking dead but simply hypnotism victimswanna create mindcontrolled army of zombies be ready to crack few eggs including your ownthe lame plot man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend whom she loves jealous this sends man into spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mindcontrol techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over woman who isnt worth spitthis includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments ive ever seen youd have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming the acting isnt even good this movie makes the racially insensitive king of the zombies which appeared on the same double bill dvd bought seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is classic it makes the atomic age scifi alien zombie cheese fest invisible invaders seem like serious drama this is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many korean film fan twitch south korean films are often known for their use of melodrama the credits list the ironically named company favorite films im not sure whose favorite film this would be but theyre obviously an idiotnot recommended for fans of zombies romance or classic films,negative
the complaints are valid to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women am okay with these night time soaps like greys anatomy or ugly betty or west wing because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end however when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men taye diggs tim daly and chris lowell into sexual tension and romps and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in socalled little hospital it seems like general hospitalor female counterpart to baywatch that was what men wanted and they had it so if this is what women want so be it but the idea that this is high brow show or something men will watch is unrealistic,negative
this movie was one of the best movies that have seen this year didnt see any cameos in the movie but it is still pretty good it is similar to anchorman in the humor department but think this is better put together movie it actually has point if you are going to see whole bunch of ta you will be disappointed just well put together movie if you have nothing to do for the day or you need lot of humor you will find this to be really good movie definitely think that ebert and roepers review of this movie is right on mean dont really like ebert on most movies but this is the movie that will agree about the movie contains good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie yea sure you get laughed at when it is found out about but it still suggests that you wait steve did wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet it is still funny,positive

two hours ago was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography it is quite understandable how it won the prize of best camera in cannes close ups predominated it close ups of walls humans and of many other things the warm colored lighting which is also usually by the director gave the movie warm atmosphere only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it an interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time each one of these themes represented certain atmosphere during the whole movie silence and slow movements characterize the movie some scenes were extended moments or serious of closeups not only tony leung deserves prize for his superb acting since maggie cheung was also so brilliant wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes the story was also connected somehow with the history of hong kong and the region the 1960s this prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end in short would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema,positive
luckily for bill murray this is such lightweight project since he pretty much has to carry it meatballs is the story of lowrent camp northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named camp mohawk which culminates in twoday olympiad competition above it all is bill murray clowning around and making pretty memorable film debutthe film is sprinkled with mediumsized laughs chuckles and more than few guffaws along the way the biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while hes sleeping morty or micky as everyone calls him wakes up along the side of road strung up in some trees several feet above the ground and finally floating on raft in the middle of the lake there are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another but this is pg rated film with little in the way of raunchinessthe film takes serious note involving shy camper named rudy who is played by chris makepeace of course its up to murray to teach the kid how to open up and give him the confidence he needs to run marathon during the olympiad the sentimentality of rudys situation seems tacked on to great degree notice how when murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him you must be the short depressed kid we ordered makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or murray was just adlibbing while the cameras were rolling in other words murray might as well have said to makepeace you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesnt fit in but before its all over murrays performance makes this plot device more than bearable he really seems to have some good chemistry with makepeacethe film culminates with the games between the two rival camps very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable but it just doesnt matter this is pretty good film on many levels dont let the absurd rating this film is currently getting scare you off murray will keep you laughing throughout just be warned avoid the sequels especially the one with corey feldman of starsthe hound,positive

anyone who thinks kool moe dee carol alt and corey feldman comprise list of good actors must be smoking something id love to try sometime where to begin lousy soundtrack hammy acting action in places this is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washedup hasbeen and neverwass love to star in actually felt embarrassed for the stars in this film the only thespian missing to top this turd was gary coleman who if he would have been in the movie would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad rather than just plain badthere was one part in the film where carol alt screamed do you think im an idiot yes carol do your agent does and please for the love of all that is decent and holy go away and stop degrading yourself like this this film is something anna nicole smith would take part ini would tell you what the plot was but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article plus my mind drifted many times during the movie anyway so barely paid attention,negative
this film could have been decent remake and gosh knows it tried or ms english tried assembling talented actors together with successful experienced writerdirector should be formula for decent film but ms englishs experience according to her imdb bio is exclusively limited to television work and it is glaringly obvious throughout this filmi am surprised that none of the reviews have read mention what found most unlikeable about this film and what kept it from reaching even portion of its potential it looked and felt like it was made for television to give some credit to ms english many of the jokes that simply did not work on movie screen would have been terrific on tv and maybe laugh track would have helped so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on tv but looked awkward or odd on big screen if the whole film had been chopped up into miniseries or sitcom think it could have worked but this is cinema and sadly ms englishs talents didnt translate cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors the writers that felt like came out of the theater half shriveled meg ryan is her usual perky cute self except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face but where did she have chance to use her talent she has made films where she doesnt recreate her stereotyped role and done them well but not here annette bening seemed to simply go through the motions such great talent and yet such poor performance enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance and it was sad to see what worked in this film in the 1930s doesnt translate to the 2000s and no one helped ms english get the changes updates or subtleties right if only she as writer director and producer had reached out for some assistance think it could have been good but it was notits so frustrating to go to movie that has good stars and good writer or director and come away feeling it was waste of everyones time money this new yorker cartoon saw yesterday is appropriate few movie execs are having meeting the caption reads lets remake classic with worse everything,negative
find it very intriguing that lee radziwill jackie kennedys sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the maysles to make big edie and little edie the subject of film they certainly could be considered the skeletons in the family closet the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women id say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating ie are they nuts or am missing something this movie is hard to come by netflix does not have it facets does though,positive
cmon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written novel commenting on this episode its just an old 60s tv show this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe yeoman barrows ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in real outdoor location unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stagesthis use of an outdoor location and babe gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar showexcept few notable exceptions ie the city on the edge of forever assignment earth and tomorrow is yesterday the old series of star trek needs to be seriously mothballed and put out of its boring misery half dozen good episodes from is quite poor batting averagethis is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on he actually made lot of rubbish he doesnt deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for examplejust look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from modern point of view they used wobbly plywood for the floor cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels you can clearly see the folds in the paper every expense spared or what,negative
just watched this movie on its premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia liked not loved mork mindy as kid mostly for robin williams zany energetic performance this movie made me remember why was the original show great not really but robin certainly was which brings me to this moviei was pleasantly surprised expecting nothing more than paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show which in way it was but of course the real focus was on robin it was interesting to see robins journey from struggling street jester to national tv star and how such drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife and my hat is off to star chris diamantopoulos as he portrayed mr williams with integrity sensitivity and heart not just cute impression although it was even deadon on an unrelated note noticed that robins struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman who was underappreciated by network tv and held back creatively but thats the taxi behind the scenes biopicall in all this was very enjoyable flick in which felt got to know little more of the man behind the orkan the acting was solid by all never melodramatic like suspected and the story moved along well performances that were particularly good were by those who played garry marshall and john belushi the scene in which belushi heckles robin was hoot not great masterpiece by any means would have liked to have seen tad more about pam dawber but definitely watchable especially for those robin williams and mork mindy fans out there nanoo nanoo,positive
caught this film on azn on cable it sounded like it would be good film japanese green card cant say ive ever disliked an asian film quite the contrary some of the most incredible horror films of all time are japanese and korean and am huge fan of john woos hong kong films an not adverse to light hearted films like tampopo or chung king express two of my favourites so thought would like this well would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious badly acted film ever againi think the director steven okazaki must have spiked the water with quaalude because no one in this film had personality and when any of the characters did try to act as opposed to mumbling line or two their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted beforethe only person who sounded genuine was brenda aoki find it amazing that this is promoted as comedy because didnt laugh once even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this refreshing breath of comedy it was neither refreshing nor breath of comedy and the ending was very predictable the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such thingsavoid this film unless you want to see boring predictable plot line and wooden acting actually think that spike of bensonhurst is better acted film than thisand walked out half way through that film,negative
before begin let me get something off my chest im huge fan of john eyres first film project shadowchaser the film bgrade cross of both the terminator die hard may not be the work of cinematic genius but is hugely entertaining action film that became cult hit spawned two sequels spin offjudge and jury begins with joseph meeker convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the socalled bloody shootout which seems like poor name for killing spree meeker kills three people while trying to rob convenience store being led to the electric chair there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love who was killed during the shootout expressing his revenge for the person who killed her michael silvano washedup football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team and ends up harassing his sons coach but once executed meeker returns as revenant or as kelly perine calls hamburger without the fries whose sole aim is to get his revenge which basically means making silvanos life miserylet me point out the fact that judge and jury is not true horror film it is supernatural action film with meeker chasing silvano using his ability to change form which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator french chef with an accent as bad as his moustache drag queen clown standup comedian shotgun which fires explosive rounds an invulnerability to death although that doesnt stop martin kove from shooting keith with desert eagle to pay silvano back for killing meekers wifedirector john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations instead focusing solely on action scenes which the film has plenty of but that is the films main flaw since theres nothing to connect the action scenes together the acting is surprisingly good with keith delivering the best performance supported ably by kove as well as paul koslo who plays the washedup cop quite well kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse,negative
ye lous film purple butterfly pits secret organization purple butterfly against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai ding hui zhang ziyi and her exlover hidehiko itami toru nakamura find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after chance meetingi agree with the reviewer from paris the film substitutes convoluted semihistorical conflict for plot without giving the audience single reason to care about the characters or their causes the sudden time shifting doesnt help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless normally dont mind dark movies but the absence of light the bonejarringly shaky camera footage and the generally bad filmmaking techniques really make this tough film to watch and stay interested in also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film has chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography but dont think that helps the movie the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th century and dont believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were michael bay film the overly melodramatic moments dont add to its watchabilitythe actors are all suitably melancholy zhang ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films brooding and looking generally annoyed however at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst lovemaking scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminatorall in all very disappointing film especially seeing as how it comes from the director of suzhou he,negative
after hearing about george orwells prophetic masterpiece for all of my life im now but never having read the book am totally confused as to what ive just seeni am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel as im sure most are but only through hearsay and quotes without this limited knowledge this film would have been complete mystery and even with it im still no more educated about the story of than was before watched iton the plus sidethe cinematography is amazing hurt burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate the prostitute scene was fantastically dark piece of film makingnow for the down sides and there are plentythere is war going on at least as far as the propaganda is concerned but why with who nothing is explained there are couple of names bandied about eurasia etc but they mean nothing without explanationwho is winston what does he do where does he come from where does he work why is he changing news reports why isnt he on the front line why doesnt he eat the food in the canteen what is that drink hes drinking through the entire film why is he so weak ill why isnt he brainwashed like the rest of them whats the deal with his mother sister what happened to his father little back story would have been nice no scrub that essential for those like myself that havent read the book without it this is just confusing and hard to follow arthouse movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going onthe soundtrack was disjointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the big brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on accept that this may have been an artistic choice but its very annoying all the samealso know this has been mentioned before but why all the nudity it just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coveragei personally cant abide the way hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days we are not all brainwashed simpletons but this is few steps too far the other way can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that youve read the book because if this film really is the literal translation that ive seen many people say would find it very hard to understand why is hailed as the classic it istheres no denying that it was light years ahead of its time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date maybe this has been sort of bible to the powers that be but many scifi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storylinei guess have to do what should have done from the start and buy copy of the book if im to make any sense out of thisall in all very disappointed in something ive waited for years to watch,negative

remember seeing this film in the theater in when was yearsold you do the math absolutely loved it was tarzan for the weeks after seeing it climbing the furniture jumping around making monkey sounds it started fascination with tarzan and monkeys but oddly enough longer lasting love for christopher lambert keep in mind that saw highlander very shortly after this was the last time saw that film until about month ago it happened to be on cable as was getting ready for bed at am and even though it was late and was tired and had to be at work at am stayed up to watch this movie that loved as kid upon viewing it realized that it was not that great of film and even odder then that that andie macdowells voice was dubbed by someone else ian holme was of course solid as usual and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan he was great the depth he managed to capture in so few lines his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark were just amazingas stated earlier am lambert fan but im used to highlander the hunted and fortress in this film he was really quite good and it is shame that he never got chance to portray character with such depth againso to make short story way too long was little disappointed that the film was not that good but was glad to see that lambert was good and do not regret staying up until 600am to see it,positive

what seemed at first just another introverted french flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me on second viewing genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentationspoiler of sorts followspoor cedric he apparently didnt know what hit him poor audience we were at first caught up in what seemed really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch these two guys just didnt belong together from their first ambiguous encounter as much as mathieu and cedric were sexually attracted to each other the absence of deeper emotional tie made it impossible for mathieu an intellectual being to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beachon purely technical note loved the camera action in this film subtitles were totally unnecessary even though my french is presque rien could watch it again without the annoying english translation and enjoy it even more this was polished very professionally made motion picture though many scenes seem superfluous rate it nine out of ten,positive

from the films first shot keira knightley as elizabeth bennet wandering reading through field at dawn thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strongminded rebellious female character in period drama knew was in for something to make me want to kill myselfjoe wright seemed not only to have not read the book but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austens subtle nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawingrooms but sort of ucertificate wuthering heights thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain not to mention that jane austen and in particular is not about passion sexual tension or love its about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society which was completely ignored so that the bennets house was rambunctious chaotic place where everybody shouts at once runs around leaves their underwear on chairs and pigs wander happily through the house the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from matrix reloaded style danceorgy and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for proprietythe genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots particularly in this film to function was completely erased subtlety in general was nowhere int his film sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performancesit was so obviously trying to be serious film the humour which is pride prejudice both austens methodology and her appeal was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this pofaced melodrama and when it was allowed in was handled so clumsily pride prejudice is serious narrative which makes serious points yes but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour they are embedded in it you cant lose jane austens technique leaving only the bare bones of the story and expect the themes to remain not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavyhanded mysticalnuminous fauxbrow cinematographyelizabeth bennett is supposed to be woman an adult mature and sensible and clearsighted keira knightley played the first half of the film like an emptyheaded giggling schoolgirl and the second half like an emptyheaded schoolgirl who thinks she is tragic heroine elizabeths wit her combative verbal exchanges her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybodys follies including her own her strength and composure and her fantastic clearsightedness were completely lost and replaced with what lot of giggling and staring into the distance rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation and not genuinely raging either no these were petulant hissy fits and where the great strength of austens elizabeth at least in austens eyes was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety knightleys elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention furthermore she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strongminded and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance in which quest for blandness and weakness she was ably matched by matthew macfaydendonald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic his special bond with lizzie as the only two sensible people in world of fools was completely lost not least because both of them were fools in world of fools and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact mr bingley was no longer amiable and wellmeaning to the point of folly but was played as complete retard for cheap laughs and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen delivered with remarkable clumsiness and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in modern day romantic comedyjust get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache,negative

the story is very trustworthy and powerful the technical side of the movie is quite fine even the directing of it the main problem is with the castings that turned that movie into almost another local and regular cliché with great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression beside the small role of the father rafael played impressively by asi dayan all other actors were unfortunately not in their best the role of the elder blind girl played by taly sharon was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile there were moments and episodes that looked more like rehearsal then real movie but after all its good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future,negative

even though im quite young the beatles are my absolutely favourite band never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since can rememberits the sort of film that is worth trying the once can see why it wasnt released in the cinema but it is certainly great film to put on the tv was flicking through my tv guide and happened to see this film it didnt much details except something like john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have broken up jared harris stars id never heard of him he played john or aiden quinn who played paul however they are certainly underestimated actorsthe film had slow start but as it developed could see how well quinn but especially harris played their characters as huge fan sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney are like the script was brilliant and harris got lennons accent personality and mannerisms spot on quinn played mccartney quite well but sometimes went into his irish accent the makeup artists made them look excellentthis paragraph may be counted as spoileras mentioned before it got off to slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film found the bit in the park total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians as for lennons rude line in the italian restaurant totally unnecessary the ending was very poignant and brings tear to my eye whenever watch itit is quite different from the other biographical films ive seen where its about how the beatles got together and became famous and those never really did the characters that well eg backbeatin conclusion would say if youre beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan give it chance you may have pleasent surprise at only about minutes long its worth waiting for the film to developif anyone does know whether the meeting of really did happen please send it to the comments page for this film id be very interested,positive
an american werewolf in london had some funny parts but this one isnt so good the computer werewolves are just awful the perspective is all off its like seeing them through distorting mirror the writers step on the throat of many of their gags american boy says to parisian girl is there cafe around here instead of just leaving it at that they have to have the girl sigh and respond this is paris,negative
originally was tenacious fan of their first album and naturally listened to few tracks off the pod and was rather disappointed after watching the movie my view was changed the movie is pretty funny from beginning to the end and found my self engaged in it even though it was really was stupid storyline because of the attitudes that kg and jaybles portray in the movie much more entertaining and enjoyable than movies have seen in the theaters lately ex saw iii dull and dragging casino royale way to homoerotic which in prior installments have really enjoyed if you enjoyed borat you will enjoy the tale of the greatest band on earth,positive
this is just one more of those hideous films that you find on lifetime tv which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner along with other such nasty films as the burning bed enough or monster this film takes disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why shes not such bad person after all give us break heres my question to the filmmakers if letourneau were man and vili were year old girl would you have made picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person answer hell noimagine switching the genders in this film and then youll see just why myself and others here consider this worthless piece of garbage were the genders switched there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal instead wed likely be treated to portrayal of monstrous and hideous man preying upon young girl his lascivious behavior landing him in prison and his brainwashed victim suffering from stockholm syndrome the only reason letourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sexlets call spade spade letourneau is pedophile plain and simple no ifs ands or buts shes criminal who belongs in prison and deserves our derision and contempt but certainly not our pity or empathy,negative
the premise of this movie was decent enough but with sub par acting it was just bland and dullspoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death it was accidental so although it was murder it wasnt like the guy set out to do it also through some flashbacks there is secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to degree there is no emotion in this film the first minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister and hearing her message it was dull and boringwith some polishing and better acting it could have been pretty good,negative
the lives of the saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of london as bustling city of busy quaint streets and sunshine was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere but it gets bogged down in story that goes pretty much nowhereothello works for big fat mr karva his crimeboss stepdad at least think that is what he is supposed to be because its never really defined but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers so trust me hes prick doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy handjobs one of his colleagues is runner black dude who is always dashing from to until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running runner dumps the lost boy in othellos flat where he promptly starts granting more wishes keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled karva has the boy kidnapped but he isnt sure of what would really bring him happiness is it the innocence of being child again or is it another handjob either way dont want to see the little boy grant him the secondit just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes the ending tries to be shocking but since theres hardly any backstory on investment in any of these characters it only serves as release for the bored audiencewriter tony grisoni favourite of terry gilliam tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell ironically if he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been more enjoyable film as it is we are introduced to bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy whos origins are never revealed thats just plain irritating aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and moody score this film has little to recommend,negative
cant emphasize it enough do not get this movie for the kidsfor that matter youd best spare the adults from it as wellall right perhaps im overexaggerating little this isnt the worst kids movie no let me rephrase that this isnt the worst movie made by dissilusioned adults for dissilusioned adults and somehow marketed towards kids that would be jack which ive been meaning to review gut like fishadults wont learn anything surprising well if you must fastforward to just before the end credits for educational bit about an interesting cosmic phenominon we dont usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way well duh could have told you that so can four years of college at an art school but degressi have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie most likely it will only upset them we get to watch the moment when russ was traumatized at eight years old theres better movie kikis delivery service that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head and the adults will like it tooby the way there is moment in the movie made with amature mst3kers in mind if they think of that other bruce willis movie with sad little kid in it,negative

think this movie was supposed to be shocking but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly its been made and simply is its oneandahalf hour of torment even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie the five girlssure the main characters get their bloody piece in bad way which is basically fine since its horrormovie and usually like horrormovies ive no problem with violence in these type of movies per se however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever its no spectacle other than that its simply grotesque its so lame it even gets boring and really quick toothe worst thing if the above wasnt bad enough for ya about this movie is that theyve tried to copy the blair whitch project by filming with cheap handheldcameras but again this too serves no end whatsoever in the blair which sure enough theres an explanation namely they are their with camera looking for the blair witch in this film theres no other explanation than hey yall we wanted this to look like the blair whitch the sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about the girls are screaming so hysterically that many time you cant make out what theyre saying also no effort has been made to make anything any better soundwise or other wisethan finally theres the soundtrack which is just as bad as the rest and varies from cheap eurohouse to the worst grungy hardrockmy advise dont watch this under any circumstances,negative
why cant movie be rated zero or even negative number some movies such as plan nine from outer space are so bad theyre fun to watch this is not one the dungeon of horror might be the worst movie ive ever seen some of anyway had to fast forward through lot of it fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age there may be worse movies ive seen but thankfully cant remember them the sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint the special effects looked like fifth graders diorama set in shoebox the movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the marquis shoots and kills his servant he then immediately gets into scuffle with his escaping victim who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it without the gun having been reloaded this movie was so bad my dvd copy only had name credits guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated though guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes studio isnt needed this movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as the manipulator the worst movie have ever seen with an actual one time hollywood leading manmickey rooney the only time would recommend watching the dungeon of harrow or the manipulator for that matter would be if someone were to pay you im kind of cheap id have to have or bucks for dungeon and at least ten for manipulator philthe never out of the can cinematographer,negative
this movie took me by surprise the opening credit sequence features nicely done animation after that were plunged into semicheesy production betraying its low budget the characters typical american teens are introduced slowly with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this by the time the shlitz hits the fan we know each one of the characters and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities its slow uphill setup kind of like the ride up slope of really tall roller coaster thankfully once the action kicks in its full blown old school horror steve johnsons makeup effects are awesome equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films and the scares are jolting kevin tenney delivers his best movie ever with heartstopping surprises and creepy suspenseful setups the tongueincheek sometimes cheesy humor marks this film as pure 80s horror as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like night of the living dead or hills have eyes but for true horror fans this one is worth checking out play it as the first entry on double bill with the remake of house on the haunted hill the setup and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking,positive
though id heard that cama de gato was the worst brazilian movie of the decade watched it giving it chance after all firsttime directorproducerwriter alexandre stockler managed to make his debut feature shot in video for just us and though it looks even cheaper cant begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it then as watched it realized why but whatever chances youre ready to give to cama de gato they shrink to zero within minutes its an unbelievably preposterous verbose ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray brazilian uppermiddle class youth as bunch of spoiled neonazis hooked on bad sex drugs and violence and theyre made to look like closeted gays too made with no visible trace of talent imagination expertise or notion of structure visually and aurally it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on youtube only here it lasts ninety two countem minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness and its not even funnybadweve all seen the story before bored young guys want to have fun go partying take drugs and everything goes wrong theres gangrape spanking murder the accidental death falling down the staircase of the mother of one of the boys culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in garbage landfill moral and literal garbage get it the film is heavily influenced by larry clark especially kids and bully but clarks films though also moralist and sexploitative are highclass masterworks compared to this crapi dont think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audiences throat stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his nonstop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion you do get numbminded with so much babbling yelling inept direction shaky camera and terrible acting going on stockler doesnt care bit about technique the quality of the images framing sound recording soundtrack songs dialog sets editing etc is uniformly appalling but hes narcissistic controlfreak he anticipates the criticisms hes bound to get by adding subtitles with smartiecutie comments and by making the protagonists comment at one point how farfetched and phony it all is could relate to that despite his megalomaniac ambitions stockler seems incapable of giving us minimum of visual or narrative structure he cant even decide if he wants gritty realism handheld video camera etc or stylization repetition of scenes use of alternate takes etc damn he cant even decide where to put his camera theres use of subjective camera for the three leads the dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever the plot exists simply to justify the directors profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for all you see is filmmaker being hateful preachy condemning moralizing without the benefit of minimum of talent or technique to go with itits very disappointing to find caio blat in this mess certainly one of the most promising young film actors in brazil with his sleepyeyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall sal mineos blat can be highly effective under good direction as in carandiru lavoura arcaica proibido proibir here hes told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly underequipped actors in recent memory he also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes so goddawful they look rather like webcam pornthe film opens and ends with real interviews with typical middleclass youth stockler wants us to take those interviews as proof of what hes trying to preach in fiction but he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees selecting highlight of abject racist sexist stupid statements which only shows assholes exist everywhere stockler wants to prove that brazilian middleclass youths are all present or future fascists because theyre middleclass and enjoy recreational drugs is he saying all neofascists are on drugs or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior couldnt tell with its dogmatic selfrighteousness headacheinducing technique and mindbending boredom cama de gato is bad for reasons but above all its harmful in very insidious manner it gives detractors of brazilian cinema powerful case of argument cama de gato is best unwatched unmentioned buried and forgotten,negative

this movie was failure as comedy and film in general it was very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey message but the message was cliché hopeless mess to begin with this movie falls on shameless environmental point even making selfrighteous point of destroying an suv and promoting animal planetin sitting through this couldnt help but notice that steve carell got no more than single truly funny line the only thing that could hypothetically mark this as comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to wanda sykes her character gets frequent cringeworthy lines where they absolutely do not fitfar from the brilliance of bruce almighty evan almighty blows its whole recordbreaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot the movie spends the first half building up to the construction of evans ark but by the end we learn that the ark was completely meaningless and the whole plot was just vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages the movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark flood and animal gathering was just weak political statement by none other than god yes god was trying to influence politics,negative
it is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as film worth seeing if you loved bulgakovs book you would be understandably afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an artfilm project than for actually bringing the storys deeper meaning to the screen there are couple examples of this with the master and margarita as complex and farfetched as the story is the movie leaves out nothing it is as if the filmmaker read bulgakovs work the same way an orchestral conductor reads scorewith not note missed why cant we find such talent here in the us so now my favorite book and movie have the same title,positive

the day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumis fate as an assassin fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first sagathats as poetical as ill get when talking about azumi death or love because when cringed over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying daggers and complained about the credibility of aya ueto portraying blooddriven assassin after watching azumi started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever beforenot only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience in azumi we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics which is their number one priority as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape but wont hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in azumis way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma by the way chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing toned down version of go go minus the cool weapon and sense of menacethis brings me to the final blow which is the action simply disguised in the title as the death side of the epic in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons to no ones surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily in azumi the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fights in azumi was at least climaxed and worthwhile some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enrichedthe romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides much needed resolutionas fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation wont lie and ill admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film but ill step right up and say that after watching azumi the original was made to look like flawless masterpiece for what its worth azumi death or love could have gone straight to video with its invisibly richer budget and failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins doing their best to restore the peace with an unwavering courage to die trying,negative

havent read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on but who knows maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health it isnt that this movie is necessarily bad for your health but book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie you can count the number of pages by anne rice that ive read on one hand but after seeing this movie and interview with vampire get the feeling that she writes really good novels the plots for both movies hint at whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire historystill stuart townsends voiceover narration gets heck of lot more annoying than brad pitts vampire narrative ever did and you can tell that queen of the damneds limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline while interview decided to go with lace and elegance queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously one can see that the original novel had potential as movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places the costumes and rock roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrackhowever ill give credit where credit is due the soundtrack is excellent korn and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like buttheadthe film opens with very cool gothrock zoom splice montage but after the first ten minutes or so the directing degenerates quickly its as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasnt enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects unfortunately queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress where are the yellow contacts wheres the pale blue makeup scene after scene shook my head reminiscing about the days of salems lot and fright night when low budget was done rightthere are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage props to aaliyah and may her soul forever rest in peace she might have become renowned actress had her life not been taken from us so prematurely for she did give this movie decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing did mention that the soundtrack was good lets see what else can say it wasnt too long the anne rice novel could have easily been three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it there are few twists and turns here and there in the plot but all in all it was legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of secondrate vampire movies out there the director of this movie went on to direct new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anythingjyjimboduckdotcom,positive
while count myself as fan of the babylon television series the original movie that introduced the series was weak start although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there the pace of the gathering is slow the makeup somewhat inadequate and the plot confusing worse the characterization in the premiere episode is poor although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into spectacular series,negative
leonard maltin gave this film dreaded bomb rating in his movie and video guide what film was he looking at kid vengeance or gods gun are bombs this film is delight it is fantastic it is literate it is well mounted it is beautiful photographed making brilliant use of colors right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is welldone satire of the whole spaghetti western genre the film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to douglas fairbanks sunset strip and the famous showdown in the good the bad and the ugly edd byrnes george hilton and gilbert roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work it is too bad mr maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved one can only guess as to his reason suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be kudos belong to everyone involved in this project this film is little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire,positive

if you wish to see shakespeares masterpiece in its entirety suggest you find this bbc version indeed it is overlong at four and half hours but jacobys performance as hamlet and patrick stewarts as claudius are well worth the effortit never ceases to amaze me how clear hamlet is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the bard every film version of hamlet has tinkered with its structure olivier concentrated on hamlets indecision gibson on his passions jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of hamlets character together with the aid of shakespeares full scriptwhy does hamlet not kill claudius immediately hamlet says am very proud revengeful ambitious hamlet is extremely upset not only for his fathers death and suspected murder or his mothers marriage to his uncle but also and mostly because claudius has usurped the throne belonging to hamlet he is furious at his mother for marrying claudius marriages between royal kin is not unknown done for political reasons but that her marriage solidified claudius claim to the throne before he could return from wittenburg to claim it for himself he is therefore impotent to do anything about it and this is true even after he hears his fathers ghost cry vengeance he cannot simply kill the king or he will lose the throne in doing so he must out the kings secret and here is the tragedy at the moment hamlet is successful in displaying claudius guilt in public he has opportunity to kill him and does not why he wants it all he wants revenge the throne and the damnation of claudius soul in hell hamlet overreaches himself in classic tragic form his own hubris is his undoing he kills polonius thinking it is claudius and the rest of the play spirals down to the final deaths of rosencrantz guildenstern ophelia laertes gertrude claudius and hamlet himself,positive
the golden door is the story of sicilian familys journey from the old world italy to the new world america salvatore middleaged man who hopes for more fruitful life persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in sicily take the arduous journey across the raging seas and inhabit land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk in short they believe that by risking everything for the new world their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled the imagery of the new world is optimistic clever and highly imaginative silver coins rain from heaven upon salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous hell be in the new world carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the new world will yield all of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience the contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the sicilian people helps provide hope while theyre aboard the ship to the new worldthe voyage to the new world is shot almost in complete darkness especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within the dark reality referred to is the old world and the journey itself to the new world the old world is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive this is shown as salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left donkeys goats and rabbits in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the new world thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to certain dress code in order to be accepted in the new world it was almost suggesting that people had to fit particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit the most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the new world this shot shows an overhead view of crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another depicting the separation between the old and new worlds this shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter world that held more promiseas later contrasted to how the new world visually looks the old world seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy new world thought it was particularly interesting that the statue of liberty is never shown through the fog at ellis island but is remained hidden think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the statue of liberty stands for give me your poor your tired your hungry seemed like joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the new world once they arrived in the americas they had to go through rather humiliating tests ie delousing mathematics puzzles etc in order to prove themselves as fit for the new world these tests completely changed the perspectives of the sicilian people in particular salvatores mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the new world feeling more violated than treated with respect where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the new world would provide the reality of what the new world required was disparaging and rude salvatore doesnt change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the new world would be like versus what the new world actually was seemed disappointing to him this attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him their character arcs deal more with cherished dream being greatly upset and dark reality that had to be acceptedthe film seems to make strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter heavenly and civilized society cleanliness marriage and intelligence are prerequisites adhering to these rules is to prevent disease immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating perhaps this is commentary on how america has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct though the rules seemed rigid they were there to protect and help the people flourish,positive

watched mask in the 80s and its currently showing on fox kids in the uk very late at night remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was its just plain awful it is no where near in the same league as the transformers heman or thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made only watch it on fox kids because ulysses comes on straight after it thats if mask doesnt put me to sleep first one of the lesser 80s cartoons that hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on fox kids,negative
phantasm class phantasm iiawesome phantasm iiiermterribleeven though would love to stick up for this film quite simply cant the movie seems to have sold out first bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start something the others did not also too many pointless characters prime examples the kid who is crack shot funny initially but soon you want him dead the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls erm not gonna work or rather shouldnt and the blooming zombies what the hell are they doing there there no link to them in the other phatasms also there is severe lack of midgets running aboutthe only good bits are the cracking start and of course reggie bpossible spoiler coming upto me this film seems like filler between ii and iv as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main in ivoverall very very disappointing,negative
ludicrous angelic 9yearold annakin turns into whiny brat 19yearold annakin who somehow seems appealing to amidala years his senior now 22yearold jedi warrior hero annakin has couple of bad dreams and so takes to slaughtering children his friends and the entire framework of his existence because crazy old man convinced him his precious wife might really die and only he can prevent this ludicrosity squaredi think the people who like this movie are not paying attention the story is ridiculous the characters are unbelievable literally not the perverted sense of fantastic wonderful etcobiwan kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series but in the climax he hacks off annakins legs lets him burn in the lava and leaves him to suffer doesnt anyone think thats little out of character not to mention it was pretty stupid to take chance on him living as it turns outi was expecting at least story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations none of that here the story could have been written by year oldoh yeah the cgi is pretty cool,negative
scotty grant cramer who would go on to star in the great bmovie killer klowns from outer space agrees to help three middleaged guys learn how to dialog the ladies in this bad 80s comedy not bad as in 80s lingo which meant good bad as in bad with no likable characters including but not limited to kid whos the freakiest looking guy since friday the 13th part girl who leads men on and then goes into hissy fits when they want to touch her and the token fat slob because after all what would an 80s sex comedy be without fat slob well this one has two this movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of 80s sex comedies and then came the sequel thus deepening said proverbial barrelmy graded eye candy too numerous to count you even see the freaky looking kid imagined with boobs at on point think bachlor party but not as funny and very disturbingwhere saw it comcast moviepass,negative
if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it this film is actually quite entertaining its got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere casting matchups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles as evident on this board the picture doesnt pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling to get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were work of fiction know know thats hard to do when you consider custers last stand at the little big horn and its prominence in the history of post civil war america so guess theres an unresolved quandary with the picture no matter how you look at ittheres lot to take in here though for the pictures two hour plus run time custers arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher riding up as he does in full military regalia the practical joke by sharp arthur kennedy putting him up in the majors headquarters probably should have gotten them both in troubleironically lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy as in custers first meeting with libby bacon and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie hattie mcdaniel hadnt noticed it before in other films but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties mantan moreland so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in dress with that in mind the owl scene was hoot tooas for flynn its interesting to note that year earlier he portrayed jeb stuart opposite ronald reagans depiction of general custer in santa fe trail both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland in that film reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers while in flynns portrayal here its more than evident but it doesnt come close to that of richard mulligans take on the military hero in 1970s little big man lets just say that one was bit over the topthe better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on risky business venture that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on ones point of view earlier similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custers character when he stated you take glory with you when its your time to go,positive
the film quickly gets to major chase scene with ever increasing destruction the first really bad thing is the guy hijacking steven seagal would have been beaten to pulp by seagals driving but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movieit seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot so just plan to enjoy the action and do not expect coherent plot turn any sense of logic you may have it will reduce your chance of getting headachei does give me some hope that steven seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies,negative
interesting and short television movie describes some of the machinations surrounding jay lenos replacing carson as host of the tonight show film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding conan obrien and jay lenothe film does good job of sparking viewers interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the stakeholders particularly of the nbc executives the portrayal of ovitz was particularly compelling and interesting thoughtstill many of the characters were only very briefly limned or touched upon and some of the acting seemed perfunctory nevertheless an interesting story,negative
any film about wwii made during wwii by british production company has no latterday peer in my opinion respectfully the confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in at dawn we dive as descendant of admiral horatio nelson and student of all aspects of world war two and particularly naval warfare favor depictions of subs and action in the north atlantic and especially those which include the german side of things for those unacquainted with target priorities an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that submarine can hope to encounter and such rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here the pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the ealing rank and britishgaumont studios back in the day frankly prefer its quieter more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any overproduced hollywood movie ever could this reminds me of powell and pressburgers the 49th parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive eric portman favorite of mine john mills receives second billing and smaller font in the titles so this is clearly meant to be mr portmans film but the whole cast shines as for the title sequence am the only one who is utterly charmed by gainsborough productions lovely precgi gainsborough girl,positive
brilliant horror film utterly gruesome and very scary too the thing is remake from john carpenter but please do not let that put you off this film it is simply brilliant the start of the film has the aliens spacecraft hurtling towards the earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the films title in amazing shining white and blue stating the thing one of the best opening credits for horror film everthe cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their station in antartica is visually impressive on dvd widescreen it must have been great in the cinema regret not seeing this on the big screenkurt russell is excellent as macready the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base all the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected my favourite scene in the whole film has to be when macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection it is tense scary and finally spectacular love it because its funny as wellspecial mention must go to rob bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself if he didnt get an oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have this is also debatable as to whether this is john carpenters greatest filmits certainly gruesome masterpiecewait for cold winter night get some budweiser from the fridge sit down and watch the thing horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slimeutterly brilliantten out of ten,positive

no one can say wasnt warned as have read the reviews both user external but like most of us attracted to horror movies curiosity got this cat come on we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room but you know thats horror aficionados are always dying to know whats in there even if we know itll be badthe bottom line is that this movie left me angry not because it pretends to be real who caresgimmicks are allowed or because the actors and dialogue are so lame is this an unusual event in horror movies or even because the movie is so bad and am being polite here what really got me mad is that the film is not only rip off of bwp but also halfhearted lazy rip off at thati dont believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo bwp then kudos to them but they didnt even try the movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror or any movie,negative

if you liked william hickey in prizzis honor he resurrects his character as don anthony in mob boss this is very weak godfather satire with few laughs stuart whitman looks perplexed as to what hes doing in this schlockfest morgan fairchilds performance is one of the better efforts in the movie and that alone is not good sign for sure eddie deezen vacillates between three stooges slapstick and bad woody allen imitation fatally flawed mob boss is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases hidden weapons in restaurant bathroom and numerous other nonsense merk,negative
have seen most if not all of the laurel hardy classic films have always enjoyed there comical stupidly even after watching it over and over again this new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both laurel hardy however fails miserably for various reasons one of which is how out of place their cloths are still early 20th century however are both portrayed in the 90s setting some of the former dialogue was brought back however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series this film could very well be the worst film have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever the real laurel hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such bad imitation,negative

have just given for thieves highway mention this for two reasons one to prove im not git who only gives bad reviews but because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with woman of the nightwe all know pretty woman is chick flick but you cant avoid them all theyll eventually get you pretty woman for me does two things two terrible horrible ghastly things firstly it portrays prostitution as career more akin to that of dancer you know with absolutely great friends leg warmers lots of giggling borrowing each others make up you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is street walker prostitute were talking about here has great life shes healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament my feeling is this happy hooker type protagonist is lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character which for me begs the question if you make movie about type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it if make film about chef but dont want him to cook or talk about food or wear white hat then why make film about chef in the first place by bailing out and turning the hooker into respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have what cop out really really lame secondly pretty woman insults romance itself edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this lady that is without his plastic friend yep dont leave home without it especially if you are moron in suit who has no imagination out of of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another even when he first meets her its the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work necklaces here diamonds there limos over there money money money wheres the charm wheres the charisma dont mention that attempt at the piano pleasegirls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than calculator as they probably dont either so it wont have registered more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate thieves highway wonderful story of which part is based on the same subjectill finish on songpretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman the kind like to treat pretty woman dont believe you youre not the truth no one could spend as much as you mercypretty woman wont you pardon me pretty woman couldnt help but see pretty woman and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like mepretty woman shop while pretty woman talk while pretty woman sell your smile to me pretty woman yeah yeah yeah pretty woman look my way pretty woman say youll stay with meand ill pay youill treat you right,negative

strongly dislike this show mean like basically everyone at that school is perfect and rich and doubt boarding school would look as cool as that and why do they suddenly allow girls into the school isnt that just little weird anyways jamie lynn spears cannot act she always has the same facial expression which really annoys me she is basically emotionless and all the guys seem to like herand shouldnt chase tell her he likes her its not that hard really none of this show is real life and she isnt girl like me because majority of the regular girls do not go to boarding school do not have designer clothes and do not live by the beachfake fake fake,negative

this movie is without doubt perfect for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no good plot or anything like that thats ridiculous saying that jackie chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying porn movie is bad because it has no plot you watch jackie chan for the fight scenes for the action its not so much concentrated on good story or anything like that if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chans movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time porn is watched for the porn jackie chan is watched for the action think you people are rating it bad because theres no plot because you think thats how smart movie critic would rate good movie but the way see it is good movie is movie that can keep me entertained sure the middle of the movie was boring very boring but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that this did change the way how american action movies were created they have even stollen scenes from this movie if you want true man true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chans hes pure in everyway he literally makes american movies look like walk in the park and even in todays movies american movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more police story and many other jackie chan films are pieces of work of true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do masterpiece,positive
saw this at the london film festival last night apparently the shorter version james mcnallys summary of the content of the film is very good nossiter very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation homogenisation the effect of the mass media the power of capital and the need for diversitythe film is shot on handheld dv which some might find offputting but which does enable nossiter to catch people off guard on number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipmentdespite the sprawling feel of the film the editing is very sharp not only giving us parade of the worlds dogs but also undercutting number of interviewees comments with somewhat contradictory visual images and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves to degree this evoked michael moores recent work although nossiter operates in more subtle way but probably the roots of the film go back to marcel ophuls the sorrow and the pity both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of salt of the earth french peasants as the stars de montille pere et fils were present at the lff screening and answered questions afterwards we do indeed all need little disorder bravo hubertoverall an excellent film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people and organise our world,positive

this sports nice deep cast but for thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk the first third of this movie was nothing but talk and more talk most of that was bunch of women bitching about everything to each other the first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that its really chick flick and little else this probably plays on the lifetime networkthere was quick murder scene and then more talk by halfway through they had lost me by the way sally field looked about years old in here,negative

when the opening shot is us marines seriously disrespecting the us flag movie has tough road ahead but unfortunately it was downhill from there there is military adviser credited who is also apparently retired us marine making it even more baffling that this incredible breach of protocol and law went unnoticed even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how marine is reported kia then buried in very short order without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body or if there even was body the us government is still finding the missing from wwii and it takes months to identify the remains military shot down remain mia for months or years and are only declared kia when the remains have been positively identified or after years of red tape here we are expected to believe that it happens within matter of days or weeks maybe this happens in denmark but not in the us clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with or respect for the us militarybeyond that there are number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere there must have been some really extended meetings between auteur and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash having script that worked might have helped but this one seems to have been made up on the spot working from cliffs notes theres no way to know if the script was this awful originally or if it was the auteur or the middlemanagement kids at the studio who bear responsibility either way this is an awful movie that should have never been made,negative
we usually think of the british as the experts at rendering great adventure from the imperial age with the likes of the four feathers and zulu simply because the imperial age was for the most part british here in the wind and the lion we see wonderful rendering of americas own imperial ageamericas projection of power under teddy roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who despite her gentility is smitten by the rough manly nobility of her captor who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of native peoples or cultures can rest assured that the way arabs and muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing bully teddy and vivid historythough the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick there is transcendent scene at the end when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing moor on his white steed this is high adventure at its best,positive
had been looking forward to seeing dreamgirls for quite whilewhat with all its raving reviews nominations and media attention and must say the first quarter of the movie was good it really portrayed the black music scene back then however as the movie wore on me and my whole family were bored out of our wits the singing just kept coming one after the other mean seriously just one more music number and it would have broke even with rentfurthermore noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters just didnt care what happened to them even when eddie murphys character died of drug overdose knew should have been sad but just couldnt feel any emotion for that character the characters were given flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me infinally the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care which goes along with the lack of character development this movie reminded me of copycat movie based on ray chicago and rent ray and chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion overall think this movie would best suit someone who doesnt really care about an overall story yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances,negative
one of starewiczs longest and strangest short films follows toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of girl who longs for an orange the dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of car on his way to be sold but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters with the help of stuffed cat the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from terrible scurvy death the mascot features new techniques have not yet seen in starewiczs films the addition of sync sound and mixture of live action with the stopmotion animation makes for new twist on starewiczs old style of puppetry live scenes of moving cars and peoples feet walking by as puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh the honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and starewiczs utilization of the new technology seems like old hat new puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devils club scene twigss and newspaper shreds come to life skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been slow scene overall starewicz is able to update his style of filmmaking to meet the demands of new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work,positive
nice character development in pretty cool milieu being male im probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start it isnt as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher what makes this go is wonderful chemistry among the principal characters each has their own thing that they contend with once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion what enjoyed about this movie is that it didnt go for cheap comedy when it could have it didnt try to pound lesson into us the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light did have little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people,positive

was very lucky to see this film as part of the melbourne international film festival only few days ago must admit that am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life also love the majority of scandinavian cinematic offerings there is often particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth this is despite the fact that we do encounter quite number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community the audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness,positive
this movie is really bad most of it looks like it was filmed either in park or basement theres giant spider but all we see of it is one leg there are some worms that live in cave that are just cheap sock puppets with cardboard teeth and the plot is bunch of postapocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense at all the whole thing is just laughable,negative

saw this movie in the theater and was thoroughly impressed by it then again that was when claire danes was good actress not the foolish arrogant hollywoodized bitch she is today anyway this film really struck me as one of the more raw realistic beautiful friendship films how far would you really go for your best friend was moved to tears at the end and still tear up when watch it now own it remember as soon as left the theater called my best friend and sobbed to her how much loved her this is great film to watch with your best girlfriend however be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if youd do something like that for her,positive
ive seen this film literally over timesits absolutely jampacked with entertainment powers boothe gives stellar performance as fan of actors such as william shatner impulse and ron liebmann up the academy 1981i never thought an actor could capture the intensity like shatner and liebmann in those roles until saw boothe as jim jones as far as im concerned powers boothe is jim jonesthis film captures his best performance,positive
the three main characters are all hopeless and yet you only feel sorry for one of them ernesto hopelessly devoted to mercedes this was part of the frustration screaming at mercedes to get clue and ditch the nogood harry to no availthen theres the satisfaction steve buscemi has great part as transvestite and harvey keitels moving story of his indignity playing gorilla for cheap tv movie is incredible when you least expect it quentin tarintino is doing half monologue and anthony quinn turns ernesto into wealthy mantime and again great moments appear in the story but in the end its hard to know what to feel about this movie it doesnt have happy ending or even complete one but it somehow feels rightthis movie is strange but then so am no wonder liked it,positive
reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen was memorable one she appears like fresh scrubbed face tween slight and stringy but undeniably reesei have always liked her as an actor and had no idea she started this young with her career go figure actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on say that because whenever have watched her perform the characters thus far in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character quite nicely in factanyway my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland somehow assumed that was her first time up at bat not so well done reese,positive
this game ranks above all so far had the honor of playing mine on ps2 so the graphics were really good the voice acting was above standard the difficulty level is just right wesker has to be the best characters in the re series in my opinion the story amazed me and took many different twist that wasnt expecting the only rating this game deserves is great,positive
this movie is not worth anything mean if you want to watch this kind of stuff flip to hollywood movies this totally is disgrace to the bollywood name neal nikki seriously sucked never watch this movie as for the actors it appears the acting genes skipped generation tanisha couldnt have worn less and uday chopra obviously was just picked because he was the directors spoiled son all of that halla re was amazingly stupid the songs are eh and hope the director did not spend to much money on it bottom line hated the movie do not let your kids watch it and if you have it in your house it is stupid movie so discard it buy the cd if you must as said the songs are eh at least it is better then the movie,negative
this is yet another western about greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers its certainly all been done before and since but the violent men is something specialwhat makes it special is barbara stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films shes married to the crippled edward robinson whos the cattle baron here but robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent no matter to barbara whose needs are being met by her brotherinlaw brian keith that doesnt sit well with either dianne foster who is robinson and stanwycks daughter nor with lita milan who is keiths mexican girl friendthe infidelity subplot almost takes over the film but glenn ford as the stalwart small rancher who is civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here hes every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often almost expect those famous words from wild bill elliott to come out of fords mouth im peaceable man would have been very applicable in the vioilent menthe fifties was the age of the adult western themes were entering into horse operas that hadnt been explored before the following year glenn ford would do another western jubal one of his best which also explores infidelity as plot componenttheres enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well,positive
apparently the mutilation man is about guy who wanders the land performing shows of selfmutilation as way of coping with his abusive childhood use the word apparently because without listening to director andy copps commentary which didnt have available to me or reading up on the film prior to watching viewers wont have clue what it is aboutgorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling reallife footage but unless theyre also fond of pretentious headacheinducing experimental arthouse cinema theyll find this one real chore to sit through82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dischordant sound terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue this mindnumbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test ones sanity if youve still got all your marbles youll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead watched the whole thing but am well aware that im completely barking,negative
this movie was absolutely pathetic pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes at times felt like was watching an episode of beavis and butthead couldnt even sit through the whole movie emran hashmi disappoints and hrshitta bhatt is not impressive at all celina jaitley was not bad the only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on anu malik and his obsession of shayaris it was pretty hilarious the songs sini ne and its remix version were really good you can always count on emran liplocking and lipsynching chartbuster all in all it seems emran doesnt have good script from the bhatts to back him up this time,negative

this show makes absolutely no sense every week two ladies go to an estate to do some gardening and every week without fail they somehow stumble upon murder because everyone who owns big house with large garden is involved in murder right but even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder wouldnt the smart thing to do be to tell the police you know the people who can actually do something about it but every week these two fools go around polluting evidence committing crimes of their own and in some cases causing more murders once they do miraculously solve the murders there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted all the evidence has been sabotaged and youd think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two wouldnt you yay weve solved the murder now like every other week lets go and confront the murderer ourselves and with no backup tell them that we know about it there is no way we could get ourselves into any danger is there rosemary and thyme is one of the worst shows on television and certainly the most ridiculous,negative
this movie was so bad it was funny for awhile there thought was actually watching parody of bad movie la for your consideration the cliffhanger scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt the script was dreadful enough but coupled with sean youngs terrible acting especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail complete with flashbacks while dangling off cliff makes it truly classically bad movie worth watching in fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an ed wood movie still cant believe how this thing got made first of all how did such bad script get the green light how did star actors get attached were they at low points in their careers questions questions,negative
meryl streep is such genius well at least as an actress know shes been made fun of for doing lot of roles with accents but she nails the accent every time her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring mrs chamberlain as portrayed here was not particularly likable nor all that smart but that just makes streeps work all the more remarkable think she is worth all or so of her oscar nominations about the film well there were couple of interesting things dont know much about australia but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played big part in the story had largely missed this when first saw the film some years ago but it came through loud and clear yesterday and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at miseryinducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues pretty good film bit different grade,positive
airport is basically slopped together mess for universal studios to try and work new twist the concorde supersonic airliner into their disasterinthesky formulabogged down with unintentional humor the best of which is when george kennedy sticks his hand out of concordes window at supersonic speed to fire flare gun at heatseeking missile following the aircrafts flight path and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep reboarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air many stars in this one including robert wagner sylvia kristel alain delon and martha raye as nervous passenger not really related to the other airport films,negative
supposedly social commentary on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the 1970s nightmare is full of bad southern stereotypes complete with phoney accents not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most american southerners this tawdry piece of work comes off as just thinlydisguised babe in prison movieespecially in its uncut original version nevertheless acting is generally above average and the late chuck connors in particular does good job of making viewers hate himeven though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes theres also changeofpace role for the late robert reed who appears as the lecherous warden and tina louise previously ginger of gilligans island made rather believable sadistic prison guard my grade,negative
ok bought this film from woolworths for my friend for joke present on his birthday because the front cover had sexual innuendo in itbut we decided it to watch it anyway just for hilarity purposesand im sorry but this has got to be one of the worst films in historyit began off alright and we thought ok this might actually be ok but after about minutes we were sadly mistakenit began when the mysterious paint baller turned out to be the most obvious character the scouseraustralian say that because he had an accent which couldnt be identified whos acting might just say was abysmalthen it got to the end and by that time we had all lost the will to live the paint ball finalsthe only thing did like about this plot is that they didnt actually win but annoyingly enough they won by defaultand know this has nothing to do with it but the name the team were given was just awful critical damage mean they could of picked more awesome name like the destroyers of the antichrist or something or thats what the film should of been called anyway,negative
insignificant and lowbrained haha 80s horror like there are thirteen in dozen yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind the special effects are tacky the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss couple of essential paragraphs the brain takes place in typical quietamerican town setting where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the coolkid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet it is here that tvguru named dr blake and his adorable petbrain begin their quest for nationwide mind controlling under the label of independent thinkers giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill how cool is that now its up to the meadowvale teenrebel to save the world the funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where dr blake and his monstrous brain actually come from there are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but thats about it meh who needs background in movie like this really theres not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the evil brain looks like an oversized sockpuppet the only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking look at the cast and crew who made this movie director ed hunt and writer barry pearson are the same men who made bloody birthday guilty pleasure of mine and plague both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry the most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great david gale whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in reanimator girl named christine kossak provides the nudityfactor and shes obviously great talent she has exactly movies on her repertoire of which this is her masterpiece in her debut she was credited as runaway model and in men and baby her character is referred to as one of jacks girls really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress,negative
does anyone remember the alternative comedy show the comic strip presents one edition featured charles bronson robbie coltrane being interviewed about his new movie glc its about man an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and have to hunt them down and kill them in sadistic and graphic manner and after glc what next for bronson were using new angle my family dont get wiped out but go after creeps just the same this accurately describes the evil that men do its bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isnt down to blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained bronson is retired hitman who isnt giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him video tape featuring interviews with the victims of the doctor not the legendary time traveler but infamous expert on torture its never really explained why the doctor is so infamous since any police state has myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous english accents as you may guess its lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like the doctors sister being lesbian so some ta can be included in many ways its like one of those nasty chuck norris vehicles that were being released at the same time but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ice cold in alex and the guns of naverone two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on sunday afternoons believe me this movie wont be shown until well after the watershed,negative
well heres another terrific example of awkward 70s filmmaking the rudimentary premise of whats the matter with helen is quite shocking and disturbing but its presented in such stylish and sophisticated fashion in the hands of any other movie crew this certainly would have become nasty and gritty exploitation tale but with director curtis harrington whoever slew auntie roo and scriptwriter henry farrell hush hush sweet charlotte in charge it became beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres the basic plot of the film is definitely horrific but theres lot more to experience like love stories swinging 1930s atmosphere and whole lot of singing and tapdancing the setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique were literally catapulted back to the 1930s with sublime depiction of that eras music religion theatrical business and wardrobes following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to lifeimprisonment for murder adelle debbie reynolds and helen shelley winters flee to california and attempt to start new life running dance school for young talented girls particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment as she falls in love with local millionaire but poor old helen continues to sink in downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia she only listens to the ramblings of radioevangelist fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies the script although not entirely without flaws is well written and the film is adequately paced theres never dull moment in whats the matter with helen although the singing tapdancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot but the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of shelley winters shes downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady whos about to snap any second and especially during the last ten minutes or so she looks more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers jason voorhees and michael myers combined there are several terrific supportive characters who are sadly little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential like michéal macliammóir as the cocky elocution teacher agnes moorehead as the creepy priestess and timothy carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies house there are couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the grand guignol fanatics among us but particularly the set pieces and costume designs even nominated for an oscar are breathtaking,positive
resnais wow the genius who brought us hiroshima mon amour takes on the challenge of making 1930s french musical in vibrant colour the opening voiceover with old embellished intertitles was nice touch then the camera aperture opens like the old hand crankers on black white placard the camera backs off or rather up suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for tea party this is all in the first secondsthen the music starts rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film and yes speak french so cant blame it on the subtitles those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song then they leave and finally audrey tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue minutes into the filmim not sure what resnais intended by starting off with such yawning waste of time musical cacophony but the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out enduredit didnt get much better ill tell you why there is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters we dont even see their faces half the time as resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera people flit on off stage like moths around lamp and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot its as if you were to take every episode of the brady bunch and cram it into hour movie with bad songsthe only thing that kept me watching as long as did hour was that was looking at the camera techniques lighting and scenery which were all admit excellent but is that enough to hold your attention for hours not me maybe tomorrow ill try watching the end aw who am kidding have more important things to do im sure you do too skip this,negative
saw this movie in the middle of the night when was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch its one of those films where you stop to see what it is just for moment but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just cant turn it off no matter how bad it is one of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad its good and so bad its well just plain bad its worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that its both great middleofthenight fare if only for the fabulous tennis drag dont even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that chad lowe is so obviously male because logic does not apply,negative
this movie takes the plot behind the scifi flick doppelganger an astronaut from our earth crashing on counterearth on the opposite side of the sun and the cold war totalitarian vibes on that world and tries to turn it into pilot for tv series however the whole thing sank without trace and tv is probably better off for iteveryone here is perfectly adequate in made for tv way cameron mitchell turns in his usual solid performance so does glenn corbett who seems to be kind of poor mans john saxon who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses threat to the foundation of the world order on counter earthbut the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this scifi adventure firmly tethered on the launch padill give one example in the original template for this pilot doppleganger the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in thunderstorm and crash their ship in truly appalling sequence it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling rains and winds only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakersin stranded in space the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound things start shaking and the camera blurs into blackout and as friend pointed out it was pretty obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves on their seats the director wasnt even shaking the camera or the set ive seen episodes of the twilight zone and the outer limits that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this madefortv mediocrityand that in essence is whats wrong with stranded in space no budget no time no imaginationjust making the token gestures and hoping the scifi fan boys imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest sorry guys it didnt work im sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away and never thought of it again except as listing on their cv and thats what you the viewer will do youll remember if pressed that you once watched tv movie called stranded in space but it made no lasting impression on you and you cant recall too much about it,negative
black comedy isnt always an easy sell every now and then you get black comedy that is hugely successful like fargo for example but usually they dont often find big audiences people seem to either set their minds for comedy or for serious mayhem there doesnt seem to be big market for good mixture of both throw momma from the train was fairly decent hit yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age danny devito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in 1987devito plays an odd mammas boy named owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with the mother is played by anne ramsey who passed away shortly after this was released and she is quite caricature she is loud ugly rude and overbearing though owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself he wants desperately to have his mother offed he fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes but he clearly doesnt have the guts to actually do it himself thats where billy crystal comes in crystal plays larry donner owens creative writing teacher at nearby community college larry is paranoid wouldbe intellectual novelist who claims his exwife stole his novel and made millions off it he is currently trying to write new one but cannot even come up with decent first sentence the night was owen hears larry wish his exwife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria and borrowing the idea from strangers on train owen decides to travel to hawaii and murder larrys exwife once it appears he has done so he expects larry to return the favor and kill his mother the resulting action is often quite funny and even poignant its certainly never dull and often full of surprisesthe acting is exceptional even if ramsey was bit over the top crystal is as good as he can be and devito has always been undervalued as performer the film relies on quite bit of physical comedy which usually works often painfully so the film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes and the offbeat tone is truly refreshing have often been critical of the late 1980s as being time of artistic malaise and down right lazy filmmaking throw momma from the train takes chances both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot how many comedies revolve around son having his mother murdered the film isnt too long and it is chock full of laughs writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone of starsthe hound,positive

paul verhoevens predecessor to his breakout hit basic instinct is stylish and shocking neonoir thriller verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve played by jeroen krabbé gay alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give talk on the stories he writes while there he meets the seductive christine halsslag renée soutendijk who takes him back to her house where he discovers handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him even if it kills himpaul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on paul verhoeven is not filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself and that is one of things like best about him this film features very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards and that doesnt happen very often wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to workbut youll see what mean when you see the film make sure you get the uncut version there is also number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one ive mentioned but are lovely nonetheless man gets eaten by lions another one has pipe sent through his skull boat is smashed in halflovelythe acting in the fourth man isnt anything to write home about but its solid throughout jeroen krabbé holds the audiences attention and looks the part as the drunken writer it is renée soutendijk that impresses the most though as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct but the original fatale did it best paul verhoevens direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view all of which help to create the mystery of the story verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish but he obviously has talent and its shame that he doesnt put it to better use of all the verhoeven films ive seen this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across trust me its worth the effort,positive
accept that most 50s horror arent scary by todays standards but what the hell is this when you see title like this you expect to see blood and blood thirsty beast instead we get no blood at all and beast who either wants to take over the world or live in peace on earthyeah which is what the people wantedthe overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beastbut the title really kills the movie night of the beast would have made the fans more happy because there really isnt any blood to speak ofi like how the 50s movies had endings that left room for sequel but wisely never made one this movie isnt the worst ive ever seen but its almost up there2 out of,negative
demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs it is definitely an awful example of film so awful in fact that dont even consider it movie describe it more as thing monstrous thing thing that must be stopped at all costs my friends and first discovered this thing buried under big box of video tapes at my friends house it was late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked this one well during the minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word its just cheap poorly done ripoff of evil dead the whole story seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces have bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed ive seen bad horror movies before manos troll hobgoblins shudder would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid filmsfun fact this film is like cockroach on steroids much like the ouija board every time we try to get rid of it it always seems to mysteriously reappear kind of scary huh,negative
there is difference between film and movie film regardless of quality is ready for public consumption movie is what group of friends gets together to make over the course of weekend with camcorder in my time as viewer have seen may examples of bothon september attended screening of writerdirector jon satejowskis donnybrook now having read the script and having seen two different cuts rough cut and the finished product of this piece can safely say it is movie and student movie at that it is for lack of better word competent which is to say the director knew how to push record on camera and capture moving images the visuals are for the most part static and unimpressive and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish relationship with the characters understand that this is modestly budgeted film but some visual flair would have been appreciated and it would have gone long way toward keeping the audience interestedgranted there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well well written engrossing story and some sharp dialog steven soderberghs sex lies and videotape comes immediately to mind this movie however has neither the main story is weak and unfocused if the main plot is davie trying to mend his relationship with his father then feel this movie misses the point what got out of it is that davies main aspiration is to change the face of rock roll however we see very little activity on his part to show this while there is one dream sequence at the beginning and an impromptu performance of his at the end all we seem to get are scenes of davie listening to music or casually strumming guitar we are simply told that davie has played lot of gigs but we never see him in full rock out mode next time show dont tell the audience anyone who has taken creative writing class knows this also davie doesnt look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the 1970s he looks like hed be more comfortable in the early days of rock roll posing as james deans less talented brother in the meantime the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather cliché characters and story threads that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency ie the subplot involving terrys father if want to see film with this kind of haphazard construction will consider watching napolean dynamite again film could barely make it through the first timeas for the above mentioned dialog scenes guess should mention that they are few and extremely far between is it too much to ask for characters who do speak dont think it is when the characters do speak it is in short choppy sentences collections of oh so insightful questions angered grunts or wildly overthetop outbursts these characters simply do not behave like normal rational people working with material like this it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film al hudsons and thats just because hes doing poor imitation of sam elliott for his time on screen good director or at least one who is ready for the challenge of feature director would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them however with satejowski being so close to the material he simply doesnt see them or if he does he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because itll hurt his creative vision being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in constructive manner is the mark of selfindulgent misguided fool just ask rob schneider in the end we are left with poor highschoolset knockoff of zach braffs amazing garden state combined with the equally amazing velvet goldmine two films far more worthy of your timenow before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review allow me to offer this the best can do is compliment mr satejowski for having the ambition to make film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see however the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur this is student movie nothing more nothing less if the movie holds any promise and lets face it at this point it isnt going to come from the acting writing or directing it is this if if the people associated with this film are willing then please learn from this movie file it away and use the lessons learned on your next attempt dont attack your critics or have friend or family do it for you if you are able to do this maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution worthy of being called filmi am your audience and am willing to watch,negative

finally an iranian film that is not made by majidi kiarostami or the makhmalbafs this is nondocumentary an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the system in its ass its all about football and its funny its really funny the director says the places are real the event is real and so are the characters and the extras this is why purposely chose not to use professional actors as their presence would have introduced notion of falseness the nonactors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless your heart is made of stone you are blind excellently scripted the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness it has won the jury grand prize berlin dear reader its nearperfect where where can get hold of it,positive
sometimes you just have to have patients when watching indie horror if you can just toetap your way through the slowpaced early scenes sometimes real gem will present itself this unfortunately was not the case with satans whipwritten and directed by jason maran satans whip attempts to drag us along on boring snorefest of film with no real pay off at the end im guessing that the black white and blue cinematography must have been for reason however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue and found this increasingly annoying as the film went on the story in itself is not that bad and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic this combined with the slowpacing and lack of any real red gore made satans whip one to forget quite quickly will give it rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle but alas that could not save this boring waste of my time,negative
tainted look at kibbutz lifethis film is less cultural story about boys life in kibbutz but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general in the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves and its all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim besides the two main characters clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz is gross caricature of well evil the story centers on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows there is no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz every charactersituation represents different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc for example while the protagonist is strikingly handsome european looking year old boy his older brother is typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and brutish personality he cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother he treats these volunteers like trash after his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasnt seen in long time due to his military service he orders quote linda go take shower and cum in two minutes there is one other good character in this movie european foreigner who plays the mothers boyfriend when the animal rapist tries to hit the mothers son the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapists arm he is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members more hypocrisy the indescribably annoying french woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age or without love and gives an account of the actual act thats supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid she of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boys mom when her mental health takes turn for the worse the film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders the mother apparently cant escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone wasis always free to come and go as they choose its mystery how the boys father died but you can rest assured the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son thats the gist of this movie one dimensional characters over dramatization dry performances and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audiences head that kibbutz life was degrading miserable and even deadly for those who didnt fit in feel sorry for the guy who made this film obviously he had bad experience growing up in kibbutz but feel as though he took few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs,negative

clifton webb is one of my favorites however mister scoutmaster is not one of his best his patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny the film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality in addition the viewer is presented with numerous hamhanded references to religious faith and us patriotism that come off as overreverent rather than genuine clifton webb does his best with poor script edmund gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do the child actor lead is played by talentless child who displays flat affect throughout the entire film his sole claim to fame as performer evidently is bullfroglike low voice unusual for someone of his age however once youve heard it youve heard it and you dont need to hear it again unfortunately he is in the majority of the films scenes find this child so irritating that fast forward whenever he shows up since he has lot of scenes in this film this means that fast forward through lot of the film there were and are so many talented child actors its pity this film doesnt have any of them in it still clifton webb in the traditional broadbrimmed hat and shorts is sight worth seeing,negative

love to watch this movie lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors like raptors because they are scary my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of scene from the friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the bananai really love to watch lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem little fake but its okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and think its got good ending even though didnt really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings figured it out over time and thats the important part the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if youre watching it the first timethis is best movie,positive

there have been many documentaries that have seen in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence the thin blue line and paradise lost come to mind first and foremost but this is the first film that had me seething with anger after saw it it seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at waco was at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the fbi and afi and at the very worst an act of murder like most people when the siege at waco was occurring assumed that david koresh was completely evil madman who was leading violent cult after seeing this think that koresh was more likely slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the us government through his eccentric actions sure there were lots of weapons at the branch davidian compound but none of it was illegal it was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless and it was angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government forces on the waco site the clueless testimony of janet reno and the partisan defense of the attack on waco defense led by few of the committee democrats standing out most in my mind was ny representative and current us senator from ny charles schumer voted for the man when lived in ny state im democrat pretty leftleaning too after seeing his actions on this committee wish could go back in time and vote for damato instead for anyone remotely interested in the government this is very crucial film must see even think this should be shown in classes its that important,positive
saw this movie last night and thought it was decent it has its moments guess you would say some of the scenes with the special ops forces were cool and some of the location shots were very authentic wont be putting this movie in my dvd collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre the action is good the acting is decent the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion and the story is pretty interesting out of ten,positive
yes call this perfect movie not one boring second fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives could sympathize with perfect lighting crisp black and white photography fitting soundtrack an intelligent and harmonious set design and story that is engaging and works its one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of hollywood should rest the mark everyone should endeavor to reachbarbara stanwyck is simply stunning there was nothing this actress couldnt do and she always went easy on the melodramatic side no hysterical outbursts with this lady always thought she was better actress than screen goddesses like bette davis or joan crawford and this movie confirmed my opinion always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments it is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career and this one is by far the least interestingthe title fits this movie very well it is about desires human desires think everyone can understand actually no one seems to be scheming in this movie all characters act on impulse everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else the sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which will not go herei liked what this movie has to say about youth about maturing and about the necessity to compromise the movie associate most with this one is alfred hitchcocks shadow of doubt it creates similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured small town america the story has certain similarity with fritz langs considerably harsher movie clash by night made one year earlier where stanywck stars in similar part can also recommend it,positive
would like to know if anyone know how can get copy of the movie thats the way of the world its been about years since ive seen this movie and would like to see it again earth wind fire transcend the nation globally with their inspirational music and themes it was unfortunate that this group didnt take off like their counterparts in the early 70s but as previously stated racial tension existed in the united states which prohibited equalized exposure for the african american musical groups it is good to see that earth wind fire continuing their success would like to add this movie to my collection someone please help me if possible thank you for your attention milton shaw,positive
saw the movie hoot and then immediately decided to comment it the truth is that nature needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet some people think that if they have money they can do whatever they want to which probably is like but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful this movie is not just about kids this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do when was twelve saw some waterlilies and knew they are protected by law and didnt even dare to touch them not fearing of the law but fearing that might harm them actually am currently what so ever the acting was great the main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them hope you all think about what you saw in that movie and enjoy,positive
had some reservations about this movie figured it would be the usual bill of fare formula movie about christmas being in the middle of heat wave in late june we decided to give it shot anyway maybe we would see some snowthis movie turned out to be one laugh after another ben affleck was believable in his character but the real star of this one is james gandofini he delivered his lines with real wit about him and made great dadif you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours definitely check this one out,positive
when first saw this film around months ago considered it interesting but little more but it stuck with me that interest grew and grew and wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual vhs quality rather than the film itself purchased the criterion dvd box set and it turns out that was right the second time alexander nevsky is great film it is rousing and im sure it succeeded in its main aim propaganda against the germansthat is the most common criticism against this film and against eisenstein that it is merely propagandist and nothing else its untrue he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived by now the world is far enough beyond joseph stalin to be able to watch eisensteins films as art,positive
focus is another great movie starring william macy first discovered macy in fargo and ive seen few of his films and he hasnt yet deceived me macy is the archetypal nice guy with something to hide in focus he plays the role of lawrence newman loyal and hardworking stiff who harbours his handicapped mother at home the scene is set after world war ii at the height of mccarthyism newman is the head of human resources for company which is basically antisemite after he accidentally hires woman of jewish descent he is asked to buy pair of glasses to improve his failing eyesightunbelievably the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of gertrude hart his wife played by great laura dern as the film unravels newman will begin to see whole different world where being jewish is akin to being an animalthe movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal the chilling thought is that in some places it probably still is,positive
in brave new girl holly comes from small town in texas sings the yellow rose of texas at local competition and gets admitted to prestigious arts college in philadelphia from there the movie grows into colorful story of friendship and loyalty loved this movie it was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at very nice pace the acting was of course wonderful virginia madsen and lindsey haun were outstanding as well as nick roth the camera work was really done well and was very pleased with the end it seems sequel could be in the making kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production quite gem in the film archives,positive
despite totally misleading advertising campaign this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clichéd subpar haunted house flick with totally implausible ending clue for all considering seeing this turkey sam raimi didnt direct it although commercials for the movie play up his involvement in truth he is one of four producers its too bad that someone as talented as raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such poor movie dont think he would ever have directed something like this that task was left to the pang brothersthe screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other horror films so youll find absolutely zero original content in the messengers what we get are scene here and there that was plucked straight out of pulse couple that could have come from the birds one or two from the others etc nearly every scene almost every line of dialogue is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies the whole thing makes for such predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the surprise ending long before it comesright about here would be good time to point out that the advertising campaign centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts has nothing to do with this movie in fact everyone can see the ghosts the teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them even quite early in the movie im sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed unique angle to have any box office appeal which otherwise is entirely absent now you know so dont be fooled perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors it simply isnt there all of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes just what is guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened anyhow didnt anyone think to maybe arrest him it all adds up to profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots loud noises visual flashes and anything short of sheeted figure jumping out of closet and yelling boo all we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorlymade film about spirits attempting to warn people away from house if theres any message that the messengers delivers its dont waste your time on this movie,negative
this movie sucks ass something about heatwave in some european country complete trash theres nothing going for this movie whatsoever maybe seconds of sex but thats it there is very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off this movie is complete rash and you shouldnt subject yourself to watching it regret it its very boring would rate it zero but cant no body in their right mind should see this im sure youll regret it completely did how could they think up something this bad even mystery men was better mystery men that sucks that movie wasnt worth being made complete waste of time the characters in this are very hard to understand and good very very very bored,negative
was looking forward to the guardian but when walked into the theater wasnt really in the mood for it at that particular time its kind of like the olive garden like it but have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy itim not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit the trailers looked good but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last kevin costner movie that dealt with the subject waterworld plus despite the promise ashton kutcher showed in the butterfly effect im still not completely sold on him something about the guy just annoys me probably has to do with his simian featuresit took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away the movie immediately throws us into the midst of tense rescue mission and was gripped tighter than kenny rogers orange face lift my concerns briefly bristled at kutchers initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious sunglasses tough guy toothpick in his mouth and sportin smirk thatd make george clooney proud yeah we get it was totally ready to hate himbut then he had to go and deliver fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs darn you ape man efficiently mixing tense exciting rescue scenes drama humor and solid acting the guardian is easily film that dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy you can quibble about its clichés predictability and rare moments of overcooked sappiness but none of that takes away from the entertainment valuei had bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner started training the young guys but on the contrary the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film coast guard rescue swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen so feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and great way to introduce audiences to this underappreciated groupdo you have what it takes to be rescue swimmer just think about it you get to go on dangerous missions in cold dark rough water and then you must fight disorientation exhaustion hypothermia and lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded panicked people who are depending on you for their survival and if all that isnt bad enough sometimes you cant save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who diesman who wants all that responsibility not me had no idea what it was really like for these guys and who would have thought id have an ashton kutcherkevin costner movie to thank for the education not only does the guardian do great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero but lucky for us it also does good job of entertaining its paying customersthe gist moviegoers wanting an inside look at what its like to embark on daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian chance saw it for free but had paid wouldve felt had gotten my moneys worth,positive
going into see seven pounds wasnt clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about so within the first min or so you are completely lost in the plot have no idea what is going on and you think tim who claims to be ben is just big asshole all of this comes to an end when the twistso to speak is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie basically tim will smith was troubled and haunted by big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives by this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life tothe acting of this film is great as feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress rosario dawson to me this is one of her better movies aside from eagle eye which think is up there to she has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film other actors such as woody harrelson have very small roles and not big enough role to grasp the character although the casting of the film was still goodthis movie was definitely not what expected and certainly lot slower pace in which hoped the movie however was still pretty good nothing is revealed until the last min of the movie and everything falls into place up until then it just seems like pointless love story final thought seven poundsseven stars,positive
saw brothers shadow at the tribeca film festival and loved it judd hirsch and scott cohen are great as father and son the film follows scott cohen from parole in alaska back to his family in brooklyn he shows up there because his brother has died and he embarks on journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brothers wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family the story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives also the imagery of the woodworking business and the brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait,positive
mararía really disappointed me cant consider it as bad movie but the development just seemed too rushed and nonbelievable for it to evoke any emotions dr fermín displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of passion that one cant really understand where it was born from mean how many times does he ever have conversation with mararía maybe once also mararía never appeared to be real character instead more like film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie or else another title was needed some of the best acting came from role that wasnt really important to the story that of marcial the subintelligent yet humble drunkard of course the scenery the cultural tidbits of the canary islands and other wow moments were interesting but the movie fell short of documentary in case this was its real intention and most importantly as solid drama,negative
serum is about crazy doctor that finds serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains the mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems there is very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters the mad doctors nephew gets into car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy the results are not good this is class film with ok acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors there isnt much zombie action in this one and the effects while adequate are nothing special you can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes watch out for some nudity and bad language,negative

this is definitely must see film the excellent director alain chabat also acting as ceasar has managed to capture the very essence of the adventures of astérix the french comic books its based upon and to create fantastically modern and intelligent comedy which is also an homage to the world of animated films this movie is so funny so full of jokes both visual and spoken that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all between your bursts of laughter the only drawback is that nonfrench audience or at least nonfrench speaking audience might not get all the private jokes there are so many dialogues impossible to translate so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the french way of life that the fun might be lessened however its still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture the amazing stunts the music the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting all actors are great but the film would not be the same without jamel debouze gérard darmon and edouard baer and please dont ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books astérix et obélix contre césar and directed by claude zidi,positive
thought this movie was stunning with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi artemisia gentileschicervi portrays artemisia so beautifully with tentative yet confidant mannerisms her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watchalthough not each character was overtly beautiful this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in timeoverall thought this film was fantastic,positive
consider myself bit of connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling gentleman jim the best boxing movie ever made that is the robert wisepaul newman flick somebody up there likes me that movie might be number but gentleman jim is close number 2the movie doesnt just chronicle the rise of james corbett it also shows the sport of boxing at crucial time of transition in the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bareknuckle rules to the more gentlemanly days of the gloved marquis of queensbury rules and the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards time of acceptance and respectabilitygentleman jim is not realistic look at those days it is romanticized and yes even bit hokey at times but always delightfully so errol flynn is perfect as the gentleman jim who really isnt gentleman at all but merely fast talker from working class family alexis smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has lovehate relationship and we all know it is of course love that will win that match in the endat the end of gentleman jim the great john sullivan whose famous line was not can lick any man in the world of courseromanticism again hands over his belt to corbett this is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made realistic no but wonderful hey if you want realism watch raging bull instead that is much more realistic boxing movie but gentleman jim is lot more fun,positive
that this movie has been stapled to the wall of chapel as proof that god is truly dead am the only one that really saw rather sleptwalked through this film this is the only movie ive ever seen in the theater that regret not walking out on and demanding my money back it was just that dull and even saw highlander the quickening at the local cinema from beginning to end gibson and downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlikelies cast together by circumstance who eventually work together as best buddies the action what little there is is goofy and as dull as the skullbone of the writer thank whatever deity is chortling down at us as it observes our cinema that theres no chance for an air america,negative
well theres no real plot to speak of its just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex which can sometimes be fun too but its not in this case what else can say about this the action when happening is inventive and theres cool scene where two characters are falling from skyscraper one that has to be several miles high but overall theres not much to recommend kite watch it if you want but youre not missing much if you skip this one,negative
this is the best film the derek couple has ever made and if you think this is recommendation then you havent seen any of the others there are the usual ingredients it is just as poorly acted as their other efforts we can watch bo disrobing or auditioning for wet tshirt contests quite frequently the story is just laughably idiotic and the film takes itself much too seriously and then orang utans in africabut it has few things going for it bo looks great the production values sets costumes etc are quite good and this greatly enhances its camp value in strange way it is actually quite funny simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly,negative
some people drift through life moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye others latch on to cause another person or principle and remain adamant committed to whatever it is and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it but were all different made of different clay as one of the characters in this film puts it which is what makes life so interesting some people are just plain crazy though and maybe thats the way you have to be to live among the masses who knows who knows what it takes to make things life work writerdirector lisa krueger takes shot at it using light approach to examine that thin line between being committed and how one gets committed and obsession in committed starring heather graham as young woman who is adamant committed obsessive and maybe just little bit crazy too her name is joline and this is her story admittedly joline has always been committed person in work relationships in life in general shes woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what and when she marries carl luke wilson its forever the only problem is someone forgot to tell carl and days into the marriage hes gone off to find himself and figure it all out when joline realizes hes not coming back she refuses to give up on him or their marriage maybe its because of that clay shes made of regardless she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him which she does in el paso texas of all places but once she knows where he is she keeps her distance giving him his space and not even letting him know shes there she considers carl as being in spiritual coma and its her job to keep spiritual vigil over him until he comes to his senses and while she watches and waits her life is anything but dull as she encounters young woman named carmen patricia velazquez waitress at one of the local eateries carmens grampy alfonso arau who is something of mystic tbo mark ruffalo truck driver who has issues concerning carl and neil goran visnjic an artist who makes pinatas and takes fancy to her for joline its journey of discovery during which she learns lot about carl but even more about herself theres touch of humor touch of romance and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot and krueger presents it all extremely well delivering film that is engaging and entertaining her characters are very real people with all the wants needs and imperfections that make up the human condition rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story we see it from jolines pointofview as krueger makes us privy to jolines thoughts and therefore her motivations which puts decided perspective on the events as they unfold that along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates makes for very effective piece of storytelling theres an underlying seriousness to this subject matter but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavyhanded or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters and the result is well textured affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline character totally of her own creation she immerses herself in the part and gives performance that is convincing and believable adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between portrayal that is mere representation of person and one that is real and for this film to work it was imperative that joline be viable and believable and graham succeeds on all fronts her screen presence has never been more alluring and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes is enough to draw you in entirely its all part of the character she creates theres an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance who she is inside and out shes likable agreeable person and because youve shared her innermost thoughts you know who she is its good job all the way around beginning with the way the character was written to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life as carmen patricia velazquez is totally engaging as well her performance is very natural and straightforward and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character she has charismatic presence but is less than flamboyant and it gives her an aspect that is attractively downtoearth she is refreshingly open and upfront you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back but is totally honest on all fronts and that too is part of her appeal and as with joline this character is well written and velazquez brings her convincingly to life overall there is number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film including those of luke wilson casey affleck as jolines brother jay goran visnjic alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as tbo who with very little actual screen time manages to create memorable character the supporting cast includes kim dickens jenny clea du vall mimi summer phoenix meg art alexakis new york car thief dylan baker carls editor and mary kay place psychiatrist film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture reflecting upon who we are where were going and what we really need committed is an enjoyable experience ride definitely worth taking,positive

note to self never ever ever again watch serious movie with charlie sheen in it great comedian horrible seal this movie makes navy seals look like reckless group of rangers when in fact they are the most elite form of military in the world charlie sheen helps destroy the navy seal reputation thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies have ever seen this is great story which could be made into an amazing action movie but why charlie sheen there are possibilities for very passionate story here but sheen decides to wreck them with funny comments,negative

was looking forward to this so much being big fan of the book however when it came out remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time ive ever spent at the cinemain principle the acting the sets and the music were excellent and are the main reason why im rating this 4in this version sara is little too selfsacrificing for my taste there is no way she would have deliberately lied to miss minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls in the book she makes point of describing lies as not just wicked but vulgar theres also far too much of disneyfied ending for me saras father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the indian sunset while the book does have happy and critics might say equally improbable ending it doesnt leave you thinking oh puhleezeabout the only things true to the book were1 saras father being soldier the lines between sara and her father are you learning me by heartno know you by heart you are inside my heart saras friendship with becky and her adopting lottie although this last one wasnt developed as much as it could have been the changing of her room by adding various luxury items that part was brilliantly done the basic core rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly is there but thats about all that ispeople might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience possibly all can say to that is have two cousins aged and respectively who were big fans of this film until they read the bookif all you want is feelgood family film then this delivers if youre looking for film that actually tells the story of little princess in fact if youve read the book dont waste time with this one its such shame with cast like this if theyd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantasticam harping on about read the book this and read the book that little too much very probably but if someone attempts to adapt book especially such classic into movie then they should at least have done the same thing preferably more than once,negative

really in enjoyed watching this movie like most of the people that watched it wasnt sure that was getting whoopi goldberg is very funny comedian and she has done lot of funny movies ie sister acthowever this was not really comedy it is drama with comedic moments so if your looking for laugh riot then keep lookingthis movie is about black family moving up from nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood would say more but it think it would spoil the movie this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks but also about relations with in the black community do think that it is worth chance if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isnt for you,positive

every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie this movie is the true example of how psychological horror movie should bethe plot seems to be bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain bit about whats going on and you really want to view it for the second time but after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing movie can bea word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie this is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big bbs and lots of bloodif you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with great home theater system that supports dolby digital or dts 51ch without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on really tense situation and dont forget to switch the light offmy points on different aspectsdirection acting atmosphere sound effect 910total,positive
ken burns baseball is decent documentary it presents clear origin of the game great depiction of baseballs early years and heroes theres plenty in this movie for any baseball fan that said the film has several glaring flaws18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span its clear that burns stretched his film out to fit his nine inning concept its not even tight hours the pace on every segment is slow almost morose the music always nostalgic and wistful isnt baseball ever exciting and fun why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of tragedy talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak yakking about baseball as metaphor baseball as americana the psychology and theology of baseball enough this is syrupy mawkish drivel billy crystal is here to sell us all the yankee hokum hes sold us before ken burns uses the national anthem as the series theme song and manages to play take me out to the ballgame so many times you might vomit we get it dudeclearly burns is neohollywood fauxliberal so he spends probably third of the film on the negro leagues these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as openminded as kenny is today for shame he chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that america was segregated in those times burns falls head over heels in love with buck oneil former negroleague player and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly oneil waxes poetic about his playing days nonsenseburns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down baseball winds up as mushy gushy civilrights propaganda disguised as americana its clear that burns is not baseball fan otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering not weeping and reciting soliloquies are you listening mr burns theres no crying in baseball,negative
quitting may be as much about exiting preordained identity as about drug withdrawal as rural guy coming to beijing class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents acting success troubles arise however when the new man is too new when it demands too big departure from family history nature and personal identity the ensuing splits and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of gut check on the one hand or complete escape from self on the other hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grimbut what an exceptionally convincing particularity honesty and sensuousness director zhang yang and his actors bring to this journey no clichés no stereotypes no rigid gender roles no requisite sex romance or violence scenes no requisite street language and to boot no assumed money to float character acts and whims hongshen jia is in his midtwenties hes talented actor impressionable vain idealistic and perhaps emotionally starved the perfect recipe for his enablers soon hes the cool actor idolized by youth he was hot in the early nineties he always had to be the most fashionable he needs extremes and goes in for heavy metal adopts earrings and scarf his acting means the arts friendsand roles but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input and his selfcriticism dulled by the immediacy of success opens the doors to an irrational selfdoubt selfhatred didnt know how to act felt like phonyand to readily available drugs to counter them he says had to get high to do what director wanted so his shallow identity as an actor becomes via drugs an escape from identity hongshens disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual intermittentand doggedly his own solitude space meditative thinking speech refusal replace therapy the abstract is out and great deal of his change occurs outdoorsnot in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways bridges and highrises of beijing the physicality is almost romantic but is not the bike rides to ritan

to more real and realistic identity started to open up he says of this period in retrospect and the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects kind of dancers positioning clumsy graceful humorous telling in current circumstance if mind or spirit is lacking his legs can compel him to walk all night central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles to punctuate his end to acting and his determination to new identity he smashes his videos and tv and bangs his head till bloody against his john lennon forever poster he has let down his iconic antiestablishment artistbut hes the only viable guide he knows he even imagines himself as johns son yoko ono and adopts his mother mary as an intercessor in his hour of darkness and time of trouble the wrenching shaking pain in the parkhallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals music is so much more real than acting he says and speaks of lennons influence as showing me new way in the mental institute the lifesaving apples resistance nourishment reflect lennons presence as does hongshens need to rehang his heros poster in his redecorated roomif lennons influence is spiriting hongshens fathers influence is grounding although father and son are both actors and users drugs and drink it is fegsens differences from his son that underwrites his change for the father is more secure in himself he accepts that hes chinese peasant in line of peasants rural theater director and he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions its this recognizable identity that drives hongshen to treat him like sounding board sometimes with anger and rage sometimes with humor the blue jeans beatles and passivity in his most crazed and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being liar and fake he exposes more of himself than his father all the acts acted before were bullshit life is bullshit and to hongshens emphatic you are not my father he softly replies why cant peasant be your father under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother sister friends inmates at the rehab inst he makes some tangible connection to real not whole self as the long term drug effects recede so does his old identity indebtedness replaces pride trust distrust integrity banishes his black cloud all his edges soften you are just human being he repeats endlessly after being released from the strapdown incurred for refusing medicine back home lard peasant soap is fine with him now and his once rare and true friendships begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant backtoback fence scene with his musician buddy hongshen says of this movie its good chance to think about my life and might add become new actor one bound to art and life like lennon he has gained success without loss

how do you take cast of experienced wellknown actors and put together such stupid movie nimrod antel has the answer armored six coworkers at an armored car business decide to steal large shipment of cash themselves but just as they get to first base with their plans everything unravels quickly with plot like this youd think it couldnt be too bad at least for an action movie however in the first minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be normal everyday kind of guys they joke they laugh have few drinks together etc then we suddenly learn theyre planning to rob their own business the hero ty columbus short is sucked into the scheme because of the cold cruel world even though hes decorated veteran nice guy and reliable employee oh my oh my then in the last minutes of the film these former regular guys nearly all turn into moneycrazed psychos willing to butcher each other for cash in the last scenes mike matt dillon goes on suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend the viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty its utterly unbelievable and movie is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot would say dont waste your timetoo bad no one gave laurence fishburne jean reno or fred ward the same advice before making this picture,negative
the sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn its peak years were between and one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica gayle who had small but fanatic cult of followers she was actually able to act unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks and her subsequent credits proved it and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystiquegary graver the director was also talent probably too talented for the sexploitation genre and his skill combined with monica gayles screen presence makes sandra the making of woman pleasantly enjoyable experience the film never drags and you wont have your finger pressed on the fastforward button,positive

flynn known mostly for his swashbuckling roles and his bedroom antics takes different tack with this film and it works beautifully playing reallife boxing champ jim corbett flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from stifled san francisco bank teller to celebrated pugilist all the while setting one eye on society deb smith he and best pal carson attend an illegal bareknuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men and dog including prominent judge the next day he gets chance via smith to gain entrance to the judges private club he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land spot as the clubs resident boxer his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers up to and including the world champion john sullivan bond flynn is downright magical here he is the epitome of charm charisma and appeal in this role he looks terrific especially in hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing white union suit and does virtually all of his own stuntwork impressively his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is good match for flynn at this stage he needed female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time and she does so admirably she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell bond is incredibly burly brawny and towering yet tender when the script calls for it amusing support is provided by young and ebullient carson frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynns manager the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynns rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed few of the sets are amazingly presented some of smiths gowns border on the garish but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well its terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing but its also so much more some of it like the character traits shown by flynn is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes but lot of it is authentic like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes one line is particularly memorable believe you like me more than like you but its entirely possible that love you more than you love me its classic romantic dialogue and there are more than few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well,positive

thought provoking humbling depiction of the human tragedies of war small but altruistic view of one familys interactions with the enemy during the civil war in kentucky this movie lessens the glamor of war showing its effect on not only the soldier but the entire family unita lot of todays movies show war as an opportunity to highlight the heros and other glamorous features of war but very little attempts to show the true effect war actually takes on community this movie attempts this through retelling of persons memory of those days this movie is stated to be loose translation of an actual events when in reality this movie is probably factual reality of hundreds perhaps thousands of actual events during the civil war highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie,positive

saw this movie on the hallmark channel and thought it was wonderful especially since it was based on true man pierce brosnan was very good as the loner english man who took on the persona of the half breed grey owl the photography was beautifulthis movie made me do more research into this character archie belaney known simple as grey owl want to read as much as can about him at the time did not know richard attenborough had directed it but am not surprised like all his movies whether he is acting or directing gave it the highest rating however would have liked to have seen more in the movie about why he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their houseyou cant go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes,positive
despite having an absolutely horrid script more about that later this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors barbara stanwyck and henry fonda aside from one or two real stinkers id probably watch just about anything with them in the film as am huge fan of hollywoods golden age of the 1930s and 40s however no matter how much love their films just cant recommend this filmthe movie begins with fonda and stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort the two havent yet met but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with scene in which fonda horribly yodels while skiing it was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but stuck it outespecially when fonda fell into snow bank and this stopped the yodeling in hindsight perhaps should have just turned it off then fonda is knocked out in the fall and barbara goes for help back at the ski lodge he seems okay but fortunately she is also doctor and has him xrayed and nurses him back to health he in turn becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her despite hardly knowing each other they marry and so far the film seems like sweet but very slight romantic comedyonce home however all isnt rosy as she jumps right back into her job as family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy the film plays it all for laughs but frankly fondas behaviors were really creepyspying on her and her male patients attacking or threatening any man she treats tripping patient who already has back injury and stomping into surprise party and insisting that everyone there men and women are out to steal away his wife he comes off as combination of sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic but its all supposed to be for laughs considering that he seems like dangerous nut you would think that stanwyck would file for an annulment along with restraining order but oddly she gets mad but just cant stay mad at fonda because hes so cant think of the right wordcreepy is all that comes to mind later out of the blue multimillionaire fonda gets job working the counter at department store then through magical thinking he and babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all thing of the pastso job apparently cures anger and suspicions when this job falls through the film ends with fonda buying his own hospital giving barbara job there and they live happily ever after they dont go any further with the story but assume based on fondas character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patientsthe first portion at the ski lodge and the next did not fit well together nor did the final horatio alger inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world they were like three separate plots but despite this the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy what creepy little film thank goodness neither fonda nor stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely films,negative
find the critique of many imdb users little harsh and in many cases find that they crit the movie from very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that wants to sit and watch something just to get away from it allin this case however have to say it was bad am scifi junkie and there was nothing in this movie that grabbed me for even one secondthere was no proper storyline may be an idiot but still do not know where the government was that was so worried about these piecesthe pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these pieces is scary half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third year old kid would have been able to put them togetherthis movie was baddominic,negative
was debating between this movie and but chose inglourious basterds due to its amazingly high imdb rating must say now what disappointment expected certain amount of gratuitous violence but also expected lot of witty dialog got huge dosage of the former but not nearly enough of the latter felt shortchanged the ratio between violence to plot is very important and think this movie gets it totally wrong and the plot its that believable or really all that entertaining either save your time and money cant believe what this rating says for the gory and violent tastes of the modern masses,negative

perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is otto premingers where the sidewalks ends from really excellent script by ben hecht based on the novel night cry by frank rosenbergdana andrews is the honest tough new york policeman always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strongarm methods as much as he detests crooks when he hit someone his knuckles hurt and the man he wants to hit is smooth villain gary merrill who points up the title why are you always trying to push me in the gutter he asks andrews have as much right on the sidewalk as youdana andrews obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden painful discovery that he is the son of thief his deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendettaby twist of irony unique to the film itself dana andrews and gene tierney of laura are united once more and andrews now seems to be playing the same detective few years later but no longer the romantic beaten down by his job by the cheap crooks this time he goes too far and accidentally kills suspect the killing is accidental the victim worthless yet it is crime that he knows can break him or send him to jailusing his knowledge of police procedure he covers up his part in the crime plants false clues and tries to implicate gang leader but cannot avoid investigating the case himself the double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical satisfying and in no way compromisethe film is one of the best detective films of the 50s with curious moral values also one of premingers best preminger uses powerful storytelling technique projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism,positive
in sum overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes the director and cowriter says he wanted to mix genres in this case drama and comedy well at least here these two mix like vinegar and oil to boot the comedy is not very funny and juvenile additionally the film is not really realistic liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on eventually toward the end fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his exlovers son by that time was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with dead lover marriage of convenience and nutty exlover at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them either ismael or primarily nora to the detriment of the audience viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael her exlover confined against his will in psychiatric hospital there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the subplots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to snow balls chance in hell the actors do their best and are appealing but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing editing and lack of focus,negative
incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all roman emperors who went insane leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path know there are several versions of this and this is based on the min one that watched but cant fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muckid heard for long about the alleged shocking content of sexnudity which honestly there isnt much of here at all and boring when there is and blood but beware its the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here everything looks plain and simply like junior film school flunk project camerawork is hopelessly inept full of strange zooms failed framing and confusing pans to and from what mostly looks like huge theater stage complete with grainy cheapish photo quality lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven is it day or night are they in or outside have they changed scenes who is or is meant to be in the shot editing is the final sin here making confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum story progression and involvement there is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story but these faults distract so much its tragica story with so many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan burnt and fellinilike turkey thats only good for few gobblelaughs and peter otoole who makes most memorable tiberius oh yes which brings us to the bigname actors id like to line them all up one by one and just ask who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be part of this there ive wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time period1 out of from ozjeppe,negative

most of the comments on this movie are positive so thought would try and redress the balance came out of this movie wondering what was going on now know and still consider it to be poor movie intially discounted dream sequence as that seemed too obvious was glad that had free ticket to the movie or would have asked for my money back movie reviewers and critics love this movie which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy film the rating this movie has is so misleading in years time this film will not compare to true greats such as the godfather the film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isnt enough to save the film nor are the lesbian scenes,negative
pepe le moko played by charles boyer is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout europe and to stay free he holes himself up in the casbah mysterious part of algiers where even the police are reluctant to go until senior officer is sent from paris to capture le moko once and for all for le moko although the casbah allows him to remain out of police custody it also becomes sort of prison at the same time place he cant leave because the moment he does he knows hell be arrestedboyers performance was good and can understand why he was nominated for an oscar he captures the essence of such character perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time the movie itself unfortunately was quite letdown number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent of which ill mention two first was the idea that the police wouldnt enter the casbah that was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the casbah fairly regularly so neither the suggestion by commissioner janvier that the police wouldnt enter nor the statement by inspector slimane also decent performance by joseph calleia that they could get into the casbah but not out seemed to make much sense also found it difficult to believe that le moko hardened criminal mastermind that he was could be so quickly swept off his feet by gaby hedy lamarr to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the casbah to find her essentially giving himself up understand the irony of the final few scenes of course as pepe leaves the freedom of his prison the casbah only to find real freedom in his capture because hes shot and killed by the police just found it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such trapthis is worth watching for boyer and to lesser extent calleia but the story is disappointing and inconsistent,negative
man with the screaming brain certainly isnt perfect movie but im pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than star vehicle for bruce campbell meaning it works as kind of summary of his entire career slapstick sarcasm cheese action and happy endings campbell is as writer uneventhere are lots of things in the story that dont make great deal of sense why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because female brain has been implanted into it and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other better incarnations the scene in the restaurant where yegor and william battle for control of williams body is straight out of evil dead ii there are however lots of little touches and nonsequiturs that feel rather brilliant such as when william is in the height of his panic and screams at statue what are you looking at the movie looks like scifi channel original probably because it was the acting is actually pretty good particularly enjoyed tamara gorski as tatoya she was ruthless and cunning yes but seemed to have tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored ted raimi handled the standard bumbling assistant role admirably enough and bruce is funny as the arrogant sardonic condescending american jerk now that hes writing his own films youd think hed give himself role that he hasnt been typecast in already man with the screaming brain is bizarre nonsensical bmovie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking cinematic experience too seriously,positive
you should never ever even consider to watch this movie it is absolutely awful this isnt an overstatement it is so unbelievable and exaggerated it gets boring it is just movie where they have taken stories and plots from several movies and put it together in one they writer hasnt been able to pull it off in good wayif youd like to see pretty girls in bikinis and no brain this might be the movie for you but still you should plug your ears and just watch its not worth listeningp there are so many great movies out there and if could choose one this would be the last movie would pick but all in all its your choice enjoy,negative
tell the truth i’m bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people which is also the main reason why actually decide to see this movie and after having seen it was really disappointed and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of moviei’m surprise at this movie all completely it is like kid’s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing i’m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my accountsynopsis the story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior there they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is medieval freakjust the name it self is not really connected with the story at all they are not being role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done the story is very predictable though expected and the humor is lame and haven’t we already seen the same characters play by mc lovin’ in so many other movies like sasquatch gang think laugh thrice and almost fell sleepwell the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay and the acting is soso as expected when you’re watching this type of movie and the direction what do one expect this is the same guy who brought us wet hot american summer and that movie also sucks but somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movieanyway felt not total riff off but completely waste of time only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie can’t really see any point why should recommend this to anyonepros elizabeth bank two topless scenescons not funny dreadful story nudity and kids do not mix togetherrating grade,negative
this film held my interest enough to watch it several times the plot has holes but the lead performers make it workcatherine mary stewart julia kerbridge does great job as woman of who has sacrificed everything else to become physician she worked years to earn the money to go to medical school she is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dreammeanwhile julias sister and brotherinlaw are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece amanda arlen aguayostewart to avoid having her become ward of the state amanda is about years old from her appearance amanda is so traumatized from her parents murder that she has become mute needless to say julias 16hour days get longer caring for amandarob lowe plays kevin finney charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of julia and amanda he is always there with trick or joke to help amanda deal with her distress amanda really starts to warm up to kevin as the film progresses perhaps more than to her aunt julia starts to rely on kevin to take some of the load of caring for amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for juliathe chemistry between rob and catherine mary was great you keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film the chemistry between rob and arlen was good as well arlen managed to convey quite lot without the benefit of words the plot had julia and amanda gradually warming up to each other you can see them working out relationship as the film progresseswe discover that julias sister and brotherinlaw the meyers were involved in industrial espionage they stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer they had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft julia discovers that the meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities the plot is unclear whether the meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossedin any case the meyers are murdered in their home by of their former associates the killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the meyers before killing them the killers search the home and fail to find their prize they leave living witness to their crime amanda the killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from julia and amanda who have no idea where the prize is located eventually the killers kidnap amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchips locationeventually julia discovers the truth about kevin he is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip after some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue amanda and dispatch the bad guys the predictable ending has the three forming family and moving happily into future togetherwhat struck me about the plot were major holes kevin moves into the same apartment building as julia and amanda the day after the murder of the meyers how does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers the killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene with no concern for concealing their identity the killer that pretends to be psychiatrist is revealed to amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles he was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film there are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mentionthe film could have been lot better if the script had been refined more before filming filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort,positive
like the previous poster am from northern vermont and was inclined to like this film however not since red zone cuba have seen such confusing plot the things the people to bootleg make no sense two of the gang paddle across the border send second party across in car uhm why then they meet two others and drive up at night in to the bad guys hideout in luxury packard wouldnt just two people in flatbed truck make more sense then parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch the four fall asleep when they waken in the morning and and start hauling the whiskey out of course theyre spotted and shot at losing some of their precious cargo in the process then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in boat and float it over the border again why am told by someone whose great uncle really did smuggle in the area all one needed was to drive vehicle that could outrun than the us canada border patrol which back then had fraction of the resources it has now and dont get me started on the last half hour which made no sense whatsoeverthe only good thing can say about the film is that kris kristopherson has actually grown some charisma with the years,negative
may contain spoilers this movie was the worst movie ever couldnt even watch it all it was so bad this film is actually worse than scarecrow slayer which is saying whole lot this was worse than terror toons which at least terror toons was funny at times not even the gore in the film was good the shootings were fake and the acting was worse please do yourself favor and skip this one if you see it at the rental store then run the other way there is nothing good about this film at all if you want to see good scarecrow movie then watch night of the scarecrow or pumpkin head if you want to see an ok new cheesy movie then watch scarecrow rate this movie out of thats how horrible this film really is the worst movie ever,negative
watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line the excellent character development and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as wholewithout giving away too much of the plot it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves the story has prologue about what dancing in japan symbolizes sociologically so it isnt exactly as simple to learn to dance in japan as it is here in the us the film is lighthearted youll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags yet it is also dignified in way hard to describe all of the films characters are taken seriously as they are and none are diminished because of their imperfectionsive been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends it just so happened friend lent me the video on learning to dance is this synchronous or what think so because now im really geeked to give it try watch this wonderful family film small children might not get it but teens certainly would and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and againwhy they would make remake of shall we dance is mystery as it is perfect asis,positive
recap something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica the mysterious block is dug out and brought to research station on antarctica julian rome former setiworker is brought in to decipher the message problem is that one of the researchers is old girlfriend of his and the situation quickly turns awkward especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly soon the object is in the open the mystery continues though as the object generates huge amount of electricity it is decided to open the object but just before that is done julian decodes the signal do not open but too late and the object explodes as it is finally breached and two things unleashed on earth the first is an alien that had been dormant in the object and the other is virus that instantly kills the research staff and washington that is suspiciously updated on this historic event decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth so russian nuclear submarine carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarcticacomments the movie holds few surprises one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in good acting performance and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful well worked through and lot better than expected unfortunately the story holds lot of surprises of its own and this time not in good way actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes it is never really explained why washington know so much why washington is able to command russian submarines why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language and obviously chose english why but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus send their do not open message encoded and finally the end is as open as an end can bethe movie is little entertaining but too much energy from me must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good310,negative

had checked imdb before renting this dvd from netflix id have couple of hours of my life back im frankly suspicious when see that films director also wrote it in this case according to the credits the same guy was writter and director unfortunately an indication of the overall quality of this production there were few interesting moments eg judy tenutas scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting judyism which led me to rate this two stars rather than one those moments however were few and far between and almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me not to mention reprehensible in its violence admit went back to watch that part again to see if had missed something that would help me figure it out once id seen the whole thing nope though at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later the spinning camera technique was overused and essentially pointless found myself talking to the tv screen what or for goodness sake get on with it not recommended,negative
the endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me this truly astonishing story of horrifically abused and largely unheardof population is compelling welldocumented and enraging as an american am constantly humiliated by my countrys behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement we suck this is probably the first john pilger documentary ive seen but it immediately made me want to see what else hes done my only complaint and the reason gave this film only out of is that pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the us and uk governments demands that we viewerscitizens are complicit in our own inactionbut makes no suggestion of how to help dont know about britain but americas made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their governments doings gesture in the right direction might help these islanders cause,positive

this is very memorable spaghetti western it has great storyline interesting characters and some very good acting especially from rosalba neri her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic she steals every scene she is in and expresses so much with her face and eyes even when shes not speaking her performance is very believable she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top not that theres anything wrong with being over the top mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie toothe music score is excellent and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie whether you want it to or not there are couple of parts that are very amusing especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot theres also lots of slick gunplay thats very well donei would probably have given this movie or stars if it wasnt for two things the first being silly bar room brawl that occurs about minutes into the film this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights have ever seen in movie it is very poorly choreographed and looks more like dance number from bad musical than any kind of real fight one might be able to overlook this if it were terence hillbud spencer comedy but this is more serious western and the brawl really needed to be more realistic the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yumas cowardly mexican sidekick guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in movie like this and he wasnt at all funny all can say is where is tuco when you need him all that having been said let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is classic spaghetti western despite the faults have mentioned and all fans of the genre need to see this movie,positive
the plot michael linnett connors has done everything in films but direct and is looking for his 1st big chance he discovers molly in play and at once knows she will be big film star he signs her to contract with the stipulation that he must direct the producer agrees and their big time careers are under way what follows is recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy and oh yes theres romance and little sadness too the performances by don ameche and alice fay are top notch the music is real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard lots of dvd extras as well in this restored version released in it must be emphasized that this movie is story 1st not just tribute to silent films later years would bring similar films such as singin in the rain1952 dick van dykecarl reiners the comic1969 what is special about this film though is recreating silent movies in we see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone eraalthough some sound effects are includedin glorious bw while the rest of the movie is in pristine color one of the greatest in the silent era buster keaton who at this point was on an uphill climb is used superbly in silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game it is said that he had some input on his scenes as well but the real reason to watch the movie if your motion picture history fan is that beyond everything else hollywood cavalcade is mack sennetts film legacy it doesnt take genius to realize this movie is positive reworking of mack sennetts and mabel normands life the character michael linnett connors is mack sennett whose real name was michael sinnott and molly of course is mabel sennett had the pie throwings the bathing beauties and keystone cops he worked with buster keaton ben turpincameo roscoe fatty arbucklebody double and fell in love with his leading lady not only all that but sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well as most film viewers today prefer sound features those who were associated with short subjects and silents are left out to pasture as mack sennett fell into that category it is fortunate that there is hollywood cavalcade sennett was of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies his career started in as an actor then writer director producer he semi retired in with about films to his credit he had worked with the best such as charlie chaplin gloria swanson bing crosby wc fields keaton harry langdon arbuckle and even roy rogersin way up tharas film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career mack played it wise did only selective work for the next years in he had receive an academy award in the short subject category and another in for lifetime of work in the 1940s his presence was still felt eg here come the coeds1945where recreation of the oyster soup scene used in macks wandering willies1926is done in the road to hollywood used some of sennetts crosby films years later brought some nostalgia with the film down memory lane in which he participated with his knack of always associating with the right people guest role with the eternally popular lawrence welk his radio show came about later in the year brought rerelease of his greatest triumph tillies punctured romance1914 with sound in he was honored on tvs this is your life then his autobiography the king of comedy1954 which is great companion piece to hollywood cavalcade was published brought more concrete association with abbott costello as he had cameo in ac meet the keystone kops finally in another tribute with the compilation film the golden age of comedy so when you watch hollywood cavalcade it is the legacy of motion picture pioneer in the film at the banquet scene the camera pans over the guests at long table as we get to the silver haired mack he alone turns his head to the camera as if to say here am when he rises to give speech short while later he is at his most subdued underplaying the words given him as if to mentally convey know my influence on comedy will never end but will people forget mack sennett the individual maybe this movie will help,positive
it got to be running joke around bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any cartwright men after all ben cartwright was three times widower with son by each marriage and any woman who got involved with adam hoss and little joe were going to end up dying because we couldnt get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic tv westernperhaps if bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the cartwrights people have relationships some go good some not so good its just life and were less demanding of our heroes today so if relationship with one of them goes south we dont have to kill the character off to keep the survivors nobility intact but thats if bonanza were done todaybut we were still expecting lot from our western heroes and bonanza though it took while to take hold and change of viewing time from nbc certainly helped the secret of bonanzas success was the noble patriarch ben cartwright and his stalwart sons ben cartwright was the ideal tv dad in any genre you want to name his whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense ponderosa spread for his three children the kids were all different in personality but all came together in pinchthe cartwrights became and still are an american institution daresay more people cared about this family than the kennedys just the popularity that bonanza has in syndication testifies to that pernell roberts as oldest son adam was written out of the show rumor has it he didnt care for the noble cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious perhaps if it were done now hed have liked it better in the way describethis was just the beginning for michael landon how many people get three hit tv shows to their credit landon also has highway to heaven and little house on the prarie where he had creative control little joe was the youngest most hot headed but the most romantic of the cartwrights when roberts left the show kept going with the two younger sons but when big dan blocker left the heart went out of bonanza other characters had been added on by that time david canary tim matheson and ben cartwright adopted young mitch vogel but big loyal but little thick hoss was easily the most lovable of the cartwrights his sudden demise after surgery left too big hole in that familyso the cartwrights of the ponderosa have passed into history got real taste of how america took the cartwrights to heart when visited the real virginia city it doesnt look anything like what you see in bonanza but near lake tahoe just about where you see the ponderosa on the map at the opening credits is the cartwright home the set maintained and open as tourist attraction like baker street for sherlock holmes fans the ranchhouse and the cartwrights are realand if they werent real they should have been,positive
years ago when darling lili played on tv it was always the pan and scan version which hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format so when saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrewsblake edwards opus decided to purchase and watch it once and for allboy what terrible film its so bad and on so many levels that really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now its obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary poppins sound of music thoroughly modern millie etc but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself camelot my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in bizarre concoction of spy storywar movieromanceslapstick comedymusical darling lili suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as whole it just doesnt work at all to point of it being very embarrassingmind you the version on the dvd is the directors cut or in this case lets salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd edwards cut scenes from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are minutes into it and we still dont know whats going on or why were watching whats going what kind of spy is lili how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someones death instead we watch thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things arent helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings theres no catalyst in this storyone only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews and edwards previous successes the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows group of children who sing in the middle of forest edwards channeling sound of music its no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in that scene might have worked on certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrewsedwards other films the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie the musical moment ill give you three guesses was created just to make fun of julies mary poppins persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing striptease in the act the ending birds eye view of julie running towards hudsons plane is another wink at sound of musicthe whole thing is confusing julie plays singer born from german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on horseback they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in midsentence im like what happened herethe comedy bits are unfunny and cringeworthy every scene with the french police are pathetic wheres peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train hudsons squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing lili in the process brilliant whats also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning thats one slow moving train there the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason gave this film stars but its effect is diminished considerably because its repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see cancan dance crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too the girl in no mans land is ok even if its bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to group of injured soldiers at french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spyingthe whole project is listless and without energy the romance is unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks dazed like shes on valium but what really kills this illconceived project is julie playing german spy edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing traitor was good career decision as much as like julie shes no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari funny enough even if julie plays german spy she still comes across as cloying and cutehow bad is darling lili even after years since its release blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release,negative
this series made for televisión española tve is basically series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest sonbased on background of historical events such as the may student uprising in france the decaying franco regime the war in vietnam the rise of imperialism and others specifically related to spanish life at that particular moment one might regard this series as simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainmentgenerally treated in lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times as it should be stated anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other thingsthe best thing that can be said of this series is ana duatos rôle as mother of three children she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well manifesting that peculiar spanish penchant especially noticeable among women of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart without any resorting to the use of the brain as we say in spain common sense is one of the least common senses imanol arias offers very little apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series indeed as an actor he should not be trusted in anything which is not tv series his resources are too limited however his part as father of the workingclass household is not at all badnot really recommendable for other audiences even spanishspeakers in latin america the themes are all too parochially related to specific spot in contemporary spanish history such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references it is even probable that certain situations which cause few spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers,negative
want the minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for movie the acting was horrific used to be fan of cameron diaz and vincent donofrio will never look at them the same again keanu reeves and dan aykroyd were not surprise everyone knows they never could act thankfully only dan attempted an accent his accent was disaster as expected think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from minnesota hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time the only reason was able to sit through the whole movie was because was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read,negative
one of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers an observation which mystifies me not only directed by the acclaimed ang leeit had many young actors who were to become major stars eg tobey maguire before spiderman skeet ulrich before jericho jonathan rhys meyers before tudors james caviezel simon baker mark ruffalo jeffrey wright tom wilkinson and jewel all of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances especially meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killingwhen the biographies and accomplishments of the director even when he won an academy award and the actors are listed this film is usually omitted from their past performances discovered the film on dvd by accident and it became one of my most often watched films however it is seldom every seen on cable look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known,positive
its nice to see romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is little long and little cliché you cant help but like iti think the story was little rushed at the end but extending that would have made the story even longer superior to other romantic comedies such as days with mr arrogant and possibly tied with my tutor friendit would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema not as great as my sassy girl but still good,positive
of all the movies of the seventies none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the sentinel mean yes there were movies like the exorcist and other ones but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one if you have time check this one out you may not be able to get past the dated devices as such but this is story worth getting intothen there are all the stars and soontobe stars my absolute favorites were eli wallach sylvia miles and burgess meredith then there are the subtle clues that lead to whats going on too pay close attention had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like black and white cat black and white cake plus the books are really good as well im just sorry that theyre not going to turn the second book into film its so scary that it would outdo this movie,positive
this is apparently the second remake of this film having been filmed before in and and in so many ways it reminds me of the later film yank at oxford both films concern conceited blowhard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both ultimately show the blowhard slowly learning about teamwork and decency in this film william haines is tom brown and his main rival bob is played by frances bushman and in supporting role is jack pickfordalways remembered as the brother of mary of these three pickford comes off the best as the sympathetic loser who becomes toms palhe actually has few decent scenes as well as dramatic moment just before the big game all the standard clichés are there and the movie because it was done so many times before and since offers few surprises however it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewingin my opinion for better silent college film try harold lloyds the freshmanits football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era another reason why brown at harvard is lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again such as in westpoint and the smart set among othersand if youve seen one of these films youve seen them all well made but certainly not original and because it is just rehash of his other films anyone giving the film score of is strongly advised to see these other films42508i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the talk about overrated there are dozens and dozens of better filmshow this film got to be is anyones guess,positive
this movie illustrates like no other the state of the australian film industry and everything thats holding it backawesome talent outstanding performances particularly by victoria hill but let down in practically every other wayan adaptation of sorts it brought nothing new to macbeth no setting it in presentday australia is not enough and essentially completely failed to justify its existence apart from lets face it completely unnecessarily paying homage to the original work if theres one body of work that has been done and done and done and done its shakespeares so any adaptation if its not to be selfindulgent and pointless exercise needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the workand thats what this macbeth fails to do as it was done this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever its the same piece that we have seen countless too many times before except with guns and in different outfitsapart from the fundamental blunder no other way to put it of keeping the original shakespearian dialogue one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end during which completely tuned out even though was looking at the screen never thought had short attention span but there you goi suppose the movie succeeds on its own very limited terms but as australia continues to produce worldclass acting talent its moviemakers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work witha shame an absolute shame,negative
owen loves his mammaonly hed love her better six feet under in this dark laughoutloud comedy that both stars and is directed by danny devito with admirable assists from billy crystal and anne ramsey in the title rolethrow momma from the train is terrific comedy even if it isnt great film its too shallow in parts and the ending feels less organic than tacked on but its gutsplitting ride most of the way with crystal and devito employing great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic takes on the essence of being struggling writer devito is avid but untalented crystal is blocked and bittercrystals professor donner believes his exwife stole his book the unfortunately titled hot fire and cant write more than the opening line of his next book which doesnt come easy he teaches creative writing class of budding mediocrities including middleaged woman who writes tom clancytype fiction but doesnt know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through and an upholstery salesman who wants to write the story of his life mr pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughsperminutesonscreen an ascotwearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus girls id like to porkthen theres devitos owen lift who calls himself professor donners star pupil even though the teacher wont read his work in class owen is somewhat unusual character to star in movie manchild in his late 30s who lives with his overbearing mother anne ramsey who calls him lardass and other endearing sentiments in any other movie wed be asked to feel sorry for owen but throw momma from the train piles lifes cruelties onto this sad sack for laughs and expects us to go along thats one big reason why this film probably loses lot of peoplefor those of us who enjoy the humor of this character even identifying with him and take the rest of what we see here as lark its not as big stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy takes asking us to watch in amusement while owen enlists professor donners help in plan to kill his mother actually he first goes to hawaii to kill donners hated ex then tells the professor its his turn to kill mrs lift swapping murders as seen in hitchcocks strangers on trainas director devito not only complements his actors performances with scenesetting that places the accent on dialogue he makes some bold visual statements throwing in bits of amusing unreality to keep the audience on its toes and away from taking things too seriouslyalso helping matters is writer stu silver who keeps the laughs coming with his quotable patter you got rats the size of oldsmobiles here shes not womanshes the terminator one little murder and im jack the ripper those are all crystals words but some of the funniest lines which work only in context but absolutely kill are devitos and ramseys apparently silver never wrote another screenplay after this according to the imdb and thats shame because he had real talent for itthe best scene in this movie when crystal meets ramsey was actually used in its entirety as theatrical coming attraction presentation the only time ive seen movie promoted that way owen introduces the professor to his mother as cousin patty and when momma says he doesnt have cousin patty panicky owen loses it you lied to me he yells out slamming the professors forehead with panof course in reality the professor wouldnt groan out something witty from the floor but throw momma from the train works effectively at such moments when playing its looney tunes vibe for all its worth devito hasnt disappeared from films of course but its mystery why he hasnt really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie maybe its because as throw momma from the trains lack of mainstream success shows his kind of vision isnt to everyones tastes thats too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over and like it,positive

filmfour are going to have to do lot better than this little snot of film if theyre going to get the right sort of reputation for themselvesthis film is set in glasgow although only couple of secondary characters have anything approaching scottish accent the premise about people whos lives are going nowhere who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs could have made for really funny insightful quirky cultish film instead we have group of selfobsessed saddos and plot which has been so done to bits im suprised it hasnt been banned and are friends is sleeping with sleeps with as well oh you figure it outa total waste of time painful dialogue it sounded like something that group of year olds would have written for gcse drama project the female character was completely superfluous just written in as token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing itif youre the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it right laff everyone else run dont walk away from this sorry little misfitand one question when the group left the boring seaside town saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film to go back to glasgow why did they do it via the forton motorway services at lancaster which is in england,negative
doctor mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar but is totally worthwhile it really reminds me of the old serials from the 30s and 40s which is why id have loved to see followup movies but judging by the rest of full moons output there simply werent enough tits to satisfy the typical audience unfortunately thanks to completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for family audience which is unfortunate because without em this could have been harry potterstyle magicfest that kids would have eaten up both jeffrey combs and yvette nipar are great wasnt sure if ms nipar hadnt wandered off an alist picture onto this film she was very believable no seriously anyway its shame they didnt have the bucks to license dr strange because think this could have been total kiddie phenom,positive

it doesnt happen very often but occasionally one man can make difference big differencegeorge criles best seller charlie wilsons war is fascinating and eyeopening account of the most unlikely difference maker imaginable relatively obscure congressman from the second district of texas good time charlie was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation likable and licentious even for politician charlie wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of lufkin only really wanted two things their guns and to be left alone its easy street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known appropriately enough as charlies angelswhen asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive young aides his response is classic you can teach em to type but you cant teach em to grow tits no argument therebut even the most rakish rapscallion has conscience lurking somewhere underneath and for charlie wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter humiliating defeat of the russian military and possibly to even help hasten the end of the cold war as result fat chance huhunder the skillful direction of mike nichols and smart snappy screenplay by adam sorkin charlie wilsons war is sparkling sophisticated satire that chronicles the behindthe scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising charlies teamthe onscreen team is composed of three marvelous actors with four academy awards and nine nominations between them charlie is beautifully portrayed by tom hanks in solid slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years hes aided abetted and abedded by joanne herring wealthy houston socialite played by the stillslinky julia roberts hey why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this by all accounts ms roberts looks good and holds her own but the screenplay never gives us even hint why kabul and country is so important to her character maybe the two afghan hounds usually by her side know but we as an audience never do as for the third member of the team philip seymour hoffman steals every scene he appears in as gust aurakotos smart street wise ie non ivy league graduate cia malcontent who knows the score both in the agencys boardroom and in wilsons bedroomfor the mujahideen to succeed the most important assistance the us can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded mi21 helicopter gunships which rule the skies this takes money lots of money and eventually charlies team covertly coerces those in congress to fund the effort to the tune of billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the afghan rebels this includes topoftheline stateoftheart antiaircraft and antitank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices nasty nasty stuffthat this kind of multibillion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind congressional doors is truly alarming every american should see this movie or read this book because it reveals truly frightening aspect of the businessasusual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government oh momma wish it werent soeven though the initial outcome for team charlie was an unqualified success the unimaginable unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the taliban and others since the funding was entirely covert the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of soviet oppression and the end to russian barbarity was the direct result of american intervention yes once the russkies left so did our aid zip for schools zip for infrastructure zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the afghan people as result the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster its like the forerunner to mission accomplishedas nichols film so pointedly points out the ball youve set in motion can keep bouncing even after youve lost interest in it mike krzyzewski knows this eva longoria parker knows this little lateesha in lafayette knows this but the typical american politician doesnt so we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldnt let the world know we were the good guys talk about catch22 another mike nichols filmperhaps charlie wilson said it best we fked up the end gameagain,positive
im big fan of surrealist art but this film by bunuel with some ideas from dali left me cold bunuel had lifelong grudge against the catholic church and delighted in trying to offend catholics in fairly silly ways this is one of the silliest almost like what youd expect from smartaleck 18yearold in film class the last few minutes of the movie which have nothing to do with anything else are final nosethumbing at religionif you read the scholars regarding this slowpaced occasionally amusing film its all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression if that is indeed the point then bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible the central male character is nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies is this behavior the churchs fault for interrupting his lovemaking or is he just jerk vote for the latter think bunuel must have had lot of personal hangups and chose the catholics as the ones to blamethere are few moments where you might cry aha surrealism cow in bed giraffe falling out window poor model man shredding feather pillow woman flushing toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava or mud pithard to tell in bw the rest is forgettable selfindulgence unfortunately bunuel was still chasing the same bogeymen through the rest of his career viridiana discreet charm if youre interested in seeing surrealism on the screen check out jean cocteaus early work,negative
this ludicrous film offers the standard 1970s hippie mentality in nut shell and bores us in the process its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups naive young hippy played by the waiflike kay lenz hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys and then one day she meets the ridiculous holden already in old age hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor and she decides that she is in love with him if you think that is superficial the whole film encapsulates such scenes she keeps saying how much she loves him and she only met him it wears thin and really quick couldnt help but laugh throughout the film its obvious shes just using him as meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit corny offering of music from the 70s is also spread through the film avoid this if you can grade,negative

pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religionphilosophy the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just plain wrongexamples quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion how well in the world of the subatomic you can never definitely predict particles location at specific time you can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time also the act of observation seems to affect the event solid particles can pass through barriers all of this so far is accurate but then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through wall you could indeed do it this is complete poppycock instead the theory asserts that at our level it is possible for you to walk through wall but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief also youd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall the odds are so astronomically against itthis is but one example of how they misrepresent the science but much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer played by marlee maitlan about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and selfhate there may be some truth to that but quantum physics has nothing to do with itplus string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays instead of wasting your time with this dreck suggest you rent the elegant universe an amazing series done for nova on pbs that gives you history of physics from newton and gravity to ed witten and theory in only hourlong episodes quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation,negative
was truly looking forward to this title it sounded and looked fun the idea of someone making cheesy 50s monster movie could have been worth few laughs but instead this title only bores first off there is almost no froggg in the entire movie which is the biggest disappointment have to sit through minutes of lame drama and dialog to get few glimpses of the froggg humping bare breasted chick why on top of that the film lacks any sort of fun plot mean give me something thats bit more interesting than just bunch of talking heads wanted to see some hot chicks search for the creature in the swamp wanted to see some cuties dragged off to his lair in desperate need of rescue creature from the black lagoon stuff wanted to see few goofy action scenes of the froggg going on killing spree or it maybe escaping silly trap something exciting geez have fun with it be creative who wants to sit through endless and tiring dialog scenes in creature flick my advice to the filmmakers keep going your concepts are good but your execution needs to be lot more inspired have some fun with the creature put the humor in the action and most importantput more creature in creature movie,negative
one of my sisters friends lent me this game and it is too damn hard it carries the appearance of kids game but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions and you have to search seemingly endless levels for notes to improve your score you also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them and am only up to stage three maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this but otherwise keep away and it is definately not recommended for kids they will pull their hair out within the hour,negative
chuck joness rabbit seasoning the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy is often considered to be the best of the three while find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons would have to concede that rabbit seasoning is the most finely honed script here the emphasis is placed on language as bugs and daffy run through series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of abbot and costellos whos on next routine as long term daffy fan have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently daffy who gets all the best lines the famous pronoun trouble being one of the all time classics and does most of the work bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while elmer as always is the befuddled dupe part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that daffy and elmer pose so little threat to bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old daffy who comes off worst being shot in the face again and again his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions it all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration youre despicable as intricate an example of chuck joness impeccable timing as youll come across rabbit seasoning is true classic,positive

this movie is all ultralightweight fluff predictable from beginning to end as don knotts vehicle the incredible mr limpet was much better with knotts character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant his performance there was toned down with none of his trademark goggleeyed stare although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by cartoon fish knotts made living of playing the likable imbecile much as bob denver did neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles assuming they were simply typecast it was probably because of the slouch the wild stare and the highpitched voice john ritter whom knotts worked with in threes company was able to transcend his genre branching out successfully into dramatic roles like the dreamer of oz but the closest knotts ever got was small role in pleasantville even leslie nielsen was bad fit here uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in airplane and police squadtheres also no way the then43 yearold knotts could pass for yearold as his character insisted he was it was as ludicrously unbelievable as tom hanks at playing the collegeage forrest gumpthe film was clearly made on shoestring budget very much looking like hastilyfilmed tv episode its especially evident in the exterior scenes of the town where roy goes after hes fired its unlikely even preschooler would be fooled by the mayberrylike soundstage artificialityeven viewing this strictly as childrens movie its very disappointing its not because it lacks action or special effects although it does the pace is much too slow the situations repetitive how many times can you watch roy getting onto bus comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap with breakneck gags otherwise you risk boring them and any adults in the theater as well movies even kids movies have improved quite bit in the intervening decades even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written disneys the love bug for instance at least had some interesting race action,negative
if you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization there is an excellent book called outlaw seas or the outlaw sea and it describes in story after story how these things do happen the lawlessness of the high seas is reality for number of reasons one many of the worlds freighters are of questionable registry nationality and its difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners dont have an office in real country two many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries the crews are often like illegal immigrant workers threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices three there is often language barrier not only between the officers and the crew but also between the crew members themselves the crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence four once committing an illegal act the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than fresh coat of paint anyway its fascinating readinghorrifying story excellent movie does anyone else notice how hbo seems to make the best and most important movies hollywood has trouble releasing enough oscar worthy movies in any given year so that several of the top contenders usually come from britain jerry bruckheimer the end of quality cinemai loved the thoroughly evil performance by sean pertwee also as usual loved omar epps,positive

in all honesty havent seen this film for many years but the few times have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory as anyone who has seen it will understand first saw it as child at ymca halloween party in the early sixties and it scared the hell out of us kids in fun way remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze cant risk giving away the ending except to say that it was surprising to say the least remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out big scared holler followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed the ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to movie in film history and yet oddly moving in way you have to see it for yourself which is not easy these days dont know if its available on home video or not but it would still make great halloween feature for both kids and adults,negative
this is the only thing will be able to look back on from the year and say now that rocked it rocked hard and yet it also rocked tasty mrmeatloaf added nice little touch to this dish of film before the opening credits even rolled now that tells you something this filmed rocked even before it started now dont want to give to much away or be spoiler but this movie rocked if you have heard the new album and thought to yourself this seems bit substandard tenacious materialit is like merely playing badminton with satan what gives then this movie will elevate your appreciation for the music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic masterpiece for those who would want it better do not know what they wantbecause better would no longer be the this movie is the periodso venture if you dare to the local viewing theater if you to want to have your socks rocked,positive
youd think youre in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel miles or so from france to saudi arabia going through most of europe italy bulgaria croatia slovenia turkey before arriving in the middle east but this is not tour and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sightsredas father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the haj however since walking and taking the mule is out of the question he chooses to travel to mecca by car he cant drive and therefore enlists the help of reda to his sons protest to get him there in their broken down vehiclebut reda doesnt see the point of having him go along when his dad could opt for the plane he resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldnt understand and hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son being not the best of palsthe beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that reda is quite fish out of water through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differencesits perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with hari raya haji and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their haj the final scene in mecca is truly sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating the sights of europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destinationit certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are dont miss this and yes book early was pleasantly surprised that this evenings session was still full house,positive
watched this movie based on the good reviews here and wont make that mistake againthe first couple minutes shows that group of people have been brought together by some tragedy but you dont see what it is flashback 12hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen when the ending is finally reveled you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for big payoff that doesnt happen and means nothing to what you have been watching the only connection these people have is that they have all had bad daybut even that continuity gets lost in the boredomif this was supposed to be crash clone its complete failure,negative

firmly believe that the best oscar ceremony in recent years was in for two reasons host steve martin was at his most wittiest saw the teamsters help michael moore into the trunk of his limo and ill better not mention the gay mafia in case wake up with poodles head in my bed surprise winners no one had adrien brody down for best actor genuine applause or roman polanski for best director genuine jeers and boos but they won last years award ceremony wasnt too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and was happy to see return of the king sweep the awards even if it wasnt the best in the trilogy fellowship was much better but what let the bbc coverage down was jonathan ross getting few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but so when heard sky were doing the coverage for british tv was expecting barry norman and mark kermode to be doing the links but instead we ended up with jamie theakston and sharon osbourne oh gawd if british tv are desperate for film critics obviously they are im sure both bob the moo and theo robertson will happily fly over to la to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers chris rock wasnt too bad but hes no steve martin while the location seemed to resemble sports hall with seats put in not much of glitzy arena in my opinion the main problem had with the ceremony was the format with the minor oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats theres no such thing as minor oscar and just because the award is for best animated short or best costume design theyre as well deserved as best picture or best director all the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium what bunch of arrogant snobs the academy are becoming and quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasnt for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history as for the awards themselves best supporting actress cate blanchett no great surprise for competitive category best supporting actor morgan freeman no real complaints since freeman is one of americas greatest living character actors best actor jamie foxx most predictable award of the night yawn best actress hilary swank major surprise since everyone thought annette benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night best director clint eastwood major surprise since everyone thought scorsese was going to get the award simply because hed never won one actually im glad about this because if he didnt deserve it for taxi driver raging bull or goodfellas he didnt deserve it for the aviator best film million dollar baby again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while thought the hollywood friendly plot of the aviator would have made it dead cert for best picture while mdbs controversial subject matter would have turned lot of voters off what these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they havent done in the past mean beautiful mind beating the fellowship of the ring for gawds sake and long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts,negative
while in plane flicking through the large choice of movies came across live almost accidentally oh boy what choicei remembered vaguely seeing the trailer over year ago and completely forgot about it expecting no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about stupid reality show now can easily say this has been hell of ride dont remember last time have been so excited terrified not sure if it was the high altitude playing with my senses but the suspense grow gradually through the movie until reaching climax where you cant turn away from the screen literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails youve gotyou will first go through personal moral assessment of where you stand about the righteousness of the show you will drift from thinking how come the human being can be so vicious to why not after allask yourself would you do it then learn about the contestants their motives and start guessing you will then watch contestant pulling the trigger one by one and get excited even though you know the first candidate is safegood acting good directing with movie experience that reminds you those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still were craving for morespoilers couple of things would have changed the casting of the contestants have really been moved by the farmer and we should have had bit more like him the idea of rich writer who wants to be famous is bit stupid it felt like you didnt care about some of the contestants although this might have been done on purpose think the audience should have been able to associate with the majority of the contestants game rules big glitch what happens if the 5th contestants doesnt die when he pulls the trigger do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself they should have given chance to all contestants to live ie if 5th is blank too then no one diesinterestingly havent been bothered too much by this bad points cause really had good time just wish had some popcorn with me,positive

feel dumber after watching the first minluckily walked out and saved the rest of my brain people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highlynot because of the budget of the film or the special effects just simply good acting and getting simple things rightand most importantlynot being lame but guess this was produced for those sheeple without taste and not clue of what is good moviedont be scared of rating films lowsave your underappreciated high scores for once in life time movies keep in mind that many use imdb for trusted reviews and opinionsdont spoil the broth by sugarcoating turds peace love,negative

this has got to be the worst movie haver ever seen nielson in this movie just does not have what he needs to be funny think the reasons that the naked gun and the like movies is that they did not require nielson to be funny he just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual but when you put him in movie where he has to be funny he isnt the movie had only one good part and this may be considered spoiler by some and that the beginning credits were animated if the whole movie had been animated it might have been good had no intention of seeing this movie when saw the ads for it and the only reason did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in radio contest this is the first and probably only movie have ever walked out on on scale of give this movie score of,negative
like ghost stories good ghost stories of bumps in the night voices that cannot be explained now ive see many of them as special efx have ever more grip on todays films some times to find real gem you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories now this one very rare pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called the new house was one of the most scariest films ever saw it was on once in 1972i was only 9but nothing since then even compared to it with all the remake going on in hollywood some one should do this one as is with no more special efx than the original this episode was down right creepy as hell im lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find the only other ghost stories to even come close was the original the haunting and george scott in the changling wish someone would do more ghost stories like these,positive
okay ive watched this movie twice now have researched it heavily on the net have asked several people on there opinions have even gone to the length of reading the original sheridan lafanu classic carmilla book that this movie is supposed to be based on feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe game to play whilst watching it as the plot of the movie doesnt seem to make any sense at all here is the plot of the booklaura lives in castle in syberia with her father mr de lafontaine they carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully one day they get letter from the general man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death he makes claims of supernatural powers being at work and explains that he will visit them soon meanwhile chance encounter with strange woman results in the lafontaines looking after her daughter carmilla for several months soon laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams and begins to come down with strange illness who is this mysterious carmilla and just what has she to do with lauras condition and the generali have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it and let me know what their results are even have catchy name and would have jingle too but cant be bothered with that its called the this movie doesnt make any sense gameall you have to do is whilst watching the movie try to come up with complete plot that explains what is happening mean complete all questions answered everything makes sense absolutely completeit will have to answer such questions as why can vampires walk around in day light why are they all lesbians why is girl called bob and why does she shoot herself when is the movie dream and when is it real why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesnt make anyone bat an eyelid why does travis fontaine spot and run down zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car yet when faced with woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car accept the excuse that she is zombie too and why does he then let girl which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire drive with him in his car and then let her drive off alone with his daughter in stolen carwhat the hell is the asylum scene all about what the hell is the green goo all about why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like nurse why are there never any vampires fighting zombies what is the significance of the necklace what is it made of why does it kill vampires and how does jenna know thatin fact sod it its just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie tooi have my plot and have to admit it is not quite there but it is pretty good effortin conclusionvampires vs zombies has no moment in it where there are actually vampires fighting zombies everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this and somehow it is based on classic 19th century horror novel how why what the hell is going on,negative
this wouldve been great silent film the acting really is good at least in look ma im doing really big acting sort of wayeverything is huge every line is profound every scene is shattered by human tragedymostly felt like gagging yet like any train wreck couldnt tear my eyes away this dialogue mightve worked on the stage although doubt it on the screen it was cluttered haphazard hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe really bad dramatic workif you enjoy your melodrama in huge heaping doses you might enjoy the movie be prepared to wait however for all that melodrama this thing sure plods along at its own pacethis script mustve sounded lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves it simply doesnt work once they get around to delivering it in front of the cameraimdb does us great disservice at times when it uses its goofy computercontrolled weighted score curse of the starving class deserves less than 1characterdriven fiction is great but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution it isnt character development your characters must have motivation being drunk for while and waking up in field is not character development thats plot contrivancestay away from this movie or at the very least watch it muted perhaps youll get some amusement from all the armwaving the characters dooh and word to the wise to prove that this is truly an artsy film you see james woods in all his dangly male lookatme imthefigurativeandliteralrepresentationofthenakedvulnerabilityof man glorydont say you werent warned,negative
this movie starts with the main character lying in coma in hospital ward attended by two orderlies the unconscious main character is heard in voice over saying that the orderlies are gay the orderlies kiss watched this in dvd version and have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny it said comedy on the dvd case after all and it goes on like that had seen this in movie theater probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny and because they are supposed to sit in comedy while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isnt this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isntbrilliant brains can make anything funny people like ernst lubitsch billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact but you have to know the mechanics suppose director and coscriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those mechanics he thinks that certain things simply are funny the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over man in coma for example do not get me wrong some people can make that funny dani levy cant not for me anywaythe main problem have with this movie is that cant see reason behind the way the main characters behave could not understand why the two brothers one an orthodox jew from west germany one third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly disliked each other they are both rather bland characters their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other well one is lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin but even these incestuous relationships if anything they are embarrassing just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything betterthe acting is not bad udo semel actually came to like quite lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl lighter version than of venerable orthodox jew the direction in itself is not really bad either but maybe levy should stick to directing movies leaving the scriptwriting to someone else now heard he did comedy about hitler oi vai,negative
this story about three women is very sensitive study about muriël charlotte van den eynde the youngest laura els dottermans who is about and martha frieda pittors the oldest who is the mother of muriël they live together in the same building they have different expectations of life the vital laura wants child muriël comes from village and wants to change her life in brussels martha dreams about her youth when she was young girl in fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something for instances an accident which could dramatize this story as times goes on you discover that the director dorothée van den berghe only wants to develop psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more this movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences which is not the case so one is left with feeling of emptiness,negative
first and foremost loved the novel by ray bradbury its the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later it was one of his best books with you know fahrenheit and dandelion wine as just hoping that this movie would be all right it had lots of chances with great cast like jason robards and jonathn pryce and bradbury even wrote the script himself and on top of all that it has pam grierhow could it failthere may be spoilers withinfirst of all it was dumbed down much of the horror from the book was lost as bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to minimum all the visuals from the bookgone everything that made you squirmgoneand then theres the acting like lot of movies that disney threw out in the 80s the kids in this movie cannot act and this bugged me lot neither of them looked but or their strong friendship wasnt addressed it was more like they were acquaintaces youd think jason robards and jonathan pryce could pull this off in their roles of mr halloway and mr dark but here its like they just dont care all they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something this is far from being some of their best performances pam grier was fine as the witch but the charecter of the dust witch herself wasnt well pulled off shes lot less evil and doesnt have the presence as she did in the book and everything that was left out of the book the ballon night chase the marking of jims house the real death of mr dark what happened to mr coogan on the merrygoround the fate of the lightening rod salesman the real death of the witch and oh so much more and the special effects were bad even for the 80s the merrygoround of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasnt really creepy and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel but it makes blood boil dont see this movie but read the book its classic of bradbury,negative

rather silly little film you just may lovealthough rather corny and cliché at times it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun five teams are engaged on scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest just for the sheer joy knowing yours is the best teamnotable for several screen debuts including david naughtons first film role after his dr pepper be pepper commercials and before his major hit american werewolf in london also features paul ruebens in what believe is his first pee wee hermanesquire roll year before he became known for it and last but not least mr spin city and alex keaton himself michael fox gets his first film role here fans will remember stephen furst as flounder in animal house outside of that no names but all funny charactersdoubt it has ever made it to dvd but there are still probably some vhs copies floating around and you might even catch on late late show sometime if you do is worth your watch you may hate it but it may also become quirky little movie you come to love,positive
this is an ok adaptation of the breath taking book of dan brown cant say it is novel or very good but they made movie that you can enjoy given the excellent story the result could have been better though the movie is pretty long but at the end was feeling like some things were missing sound effects and sound tracks were very good acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak for people who didnt read the book things may look happening too quickly from my point of view instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper what makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of vatican you see neither of it in the movie too much rush and using the time not in good way these are main problems of the movie so it is worth watching but could have been done better,positive
never fell asleep during movie never this movie did the impossiblewhile many people claim the superiority of japanese horror films over their american counterparts this movie was lesson in over abundance as in the movie was minutes too long it would have helped if the movie had little more movement in the plot and the camera work but instead all we got were awkward silences and lot of slow movement the acting was absolutely terrible bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to adlib something called script did these people even get any direction were they coaxed to be boring and dull either therory wouldnt surprise mewhat was even worse was the rather unscary makeup involved with the creatures from the other side either way they all stunk dont watch this film thats all can say unless youre an insomniac,negative
what can say not as bad as many here have made it out to be the only reason even watched this film that had previously never heard of before was strictly for ian mcshanei was not disappointed in the least ian mcshane was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role hes always great to watch and for my money an extremely underused actoras for the rest of the film every other actor in the movie delivered strong solid performances these people certainly werent being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation as this was fairly low budget film but this did not mean that any of them mailed their appearances in everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to themi was even pleasantly surprised at adrian pauls performance though must admit have only ever seen him in the highlander television series before this moviethe plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life not everything ends up tied in nice neat little package for you at the end of the film anybody who expected clearcut bythenumbers connect the dots conclusion or answer at the end of the movie clearly wasnt watching the film closely enough this film is not going to tell you what the meaning of life is the idea is that after seeing the film you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over coffee certainly didno car chases no explosions no bar room brawls sounds pretty dull huh but the reality is that was completely absorbed by the film and its just well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved warning if youre the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous question as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directlyyou might not enjoy this film,positive
originally harped as sequel to the slumber party massacre series this film falls flat on its face with new title first off if you are going to include the word massacre in your films title you better deliver this one certainly does not there is no gore no on screen murders and no chainsaw as the box art would lead you to believe instead we get paper thin overdone plot about group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to football game only to be offed one by one again this film could have been ok if the gore quotient was upped bit why directors especially those doing directtovideo flicks are afraid to show any gore is beyond me now am not huge fan of excessive gore but come onwhy else would anyone rent movie called cheerleader massacre besides that problem the film suffers from shotonahomevideocamera cheapness it looks cheap sounds cheap and the actors arent all that good it tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be but even that fails the ending ends up being ridiculous mess folks if you run across this film walk away and go find the original slumber party massacre out of,negative
killer cannibal rapist is killed by crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder at his grave cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave this of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look the two cops one of who is going little crazy about the scum of the city and has drug problem are back on the case two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection sounds bit confusing really but no its just rubbishthe acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays dr vincent van gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film the other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out now im all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible if it wasnt for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness would probably have fallen asleep there is bit of gore but its never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims the zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times there is also half decent scene where the killer falls in love with sex doll the doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing have ever seen in film it is just plastic toy on fishing linethe ending is extremely bad you would expect the killer to put up much more of fight than he does god knows how they made enough money to make sequel,negative
days of heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless films have ever seen in no way shape or form would recommend it to anyoneunless youre trying to put your kids to sleep or god forbid give someone an aneurysm if could go back in time and do one thing would set fire to the reels before they were sent to theaters why days of heavens plot is simple but extremely vague long sequences devoid of dialogue compose much of the film the characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with the climax of the story does not touch you by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone the only things working are your eyes and unfortunately your ears who must listen to the sound of linda the little girl in the story who talks like man am now dumber for seeing this movie dont let it happen to you,negative
in director walt disney and animator ub iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their silly symphonies series the skeleton dance iwerks and disney had been collaborating together since the early 20s in disneys laughogram cartoon series however their friendship suffered tremendous blow when iwerks accepted an offer by competitor to leave disney and start his own animation studio that was the birth of celebrity productions where iwerks continued developing his style and technique and where he created the character of flip the frog while his work kept the same high quality it wasnt really popular and by the studio was closed later that year iwerks was hired by columbia pictures and iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance this time in color1937s skeleton frolics is essentially remake of the classic the skeleton dance the movie that borough him fame and fortune like that short film it is set on an abandoned graveyard where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play the dead rise from their coffins ready for the show thats about to begin as group of skeletons has formed an orchestra and begin to play happy tune now its not easy to be musician made of just bones as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts however the band manages to put good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra its hard to dance with loose body parts everything ends at dawn and just when the sun is about to rise again the skeletons run towards their gravesdirected and animated by ub iwerks himself skeleton frolics follows faithfully the pattern set by the skeleton dance years before although with crucial difference iwerks did the whole film in technicolor the bright tonalities allowed iwerks to create more visually appealing film and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving disney creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before it is certainly more experimental film than the skeleton dance although sadly this doesnt mean its necessarily better film for starters the film is practically identical to the one he did with disney with the only differences being the music more on that later and the color effects it looks beautiful no doubt about it but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after allhowever it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film after all iwerks executes it in wonderful way but the fact that the musical melody created by joe denat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by carl stalling for the skeleton dance in other words while denats tune is effective and appropriate for the theme its easy to forget about it rapidly while stallings song has unique personality that makes it unforgettable being musical film this is of high importance and so the mediocrity of the music brings down iwerks flawless work of animation personally think that with better musical accompaniment skeleton frolics would be remembered as fondly as the skeleton dance despite not being as groundbreaking as its still fun film to watchits kind of sad that most of the work iwerks did after leaving disney is now forgotten due to his poor success however it must be said that if iwerks lacked the popularity of disney or fleischer disneys main rival he did not lack the quality of those companies films it was probably just case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to disneys mouse for the first time to face failure out of disney despite its shortcomings skeleton frolics is very funny and visually breathtaking film that while not exactly the most original and fresh film one just cant help but thinking of the skeleton dance while watching it it definitely reminds us that iwerks skeletons are still here to haunt us and inspire us810,positive
yes indeed it could have been good movie love biangle sorry for the poetical license but is not triangle an interesting story unfortunately badly told the image is sometimes weird sometimes ok the picture looks crowded and narrowsighted the sound needs more attention it usually does in romanian movies the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen the soundtrack is short and is not helping the action about the acting sorry but the best actress is the landlady the others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer the acting is poetical when it should be realistic and realistic when it should be poetical its picture for adults told by the children bother only if extremely curious,negative

this is an excellent film about the characters in adult swimming class their problems relationships and interactions with each other it should have managed wider distribution as its much better than similar films from major studios out at the same timethe swimming instructor is an almostolympian reduced to teaching adults basic lessons and often the target of horndogging from his female students he attempts more or less to fend them off with varying resultsthe students characters are mainstream usa teachers policemen college students and retired people all of whom havent learned to swim for some reason the movie covers their relationships including friends relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class several subplots provide amusing fodder including teacher going through divorce some high school students making documentary and girl who is only in the class to meet guysthis is good date movie or just one to watch when youre in the mood for romantic drama with overtones of reality,positive

watched six of kind for wc fields hes only in it for around minutes and has one long scene the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville and several other great moments the reamaining minutes are also delightful thankfully mostly due to the hilarious charlie ruggles as the bumbling banker pinkham whinney he is everyones foil he stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure also his comedy partner mary boland plays his wife flora joining in the proceedings are george burns and gracie allen boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end but gracie and ruggles use up most of the picture gracies funny quite but she can also get tiring and poor george burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat gracie all the time dont remember laughing at him once although he has one great scene with ruggles where ruggles tries desperately to get george to take gracie and leave him and his wife alone for while and one with fields where he asks fields to sell him sweater that bit is exclusively fields though the situation is constantly funny the whinneys are going to drive to california but to help them with expenses george and gracie are recruited,positive

this movie is lame and not funny at all the plot doesnt even make sense some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens doorway to another dimension maybe hell and his daughter gets sucked through it or something then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears skimpy outfit guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her the main character is guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously shes more interested in her new girlfriend and they stumble upon this witch spell book they want to be witches or something and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently there is topless scenes for no reason and guy in it who my boyfriend says is well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie im sure the topless girls doesnt hurt there either the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing who are these people and what are they doing basically this is gocampingtomakeoutthenfightamonster movie but there are bunch of things like the other dimension and book seller than make it confusing didnt like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal dont recommend watching it though it was just too stupid cant think of any part of the movie that was good,negative
although was hoping that id like it little more this was still certainly an impressive film there were great performances by all the leads and the story while not what id call chilling was still effective and it kept me interested for me the best part of this film was the look of the picture for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well also thought that the low budget suited this movie for dont think that crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in film this grim all things considered it fell little short of my expectations but im still very glad that finally sat down to watch this movie,positive

had been amazed by director antals kontroll back in his first american project vacancy was less impressive but decent start armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable the film never rises above the level of movie its shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver antal could have made great heist film but instead goes for an action flick then again he could have shot cool action flick but it doesnt really deliver in that department either what you are left with is one implausible situation after another group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over sum of money if you look past the sharp cinematography cast and the tight music score youre left with what could have been below average directtovideo featuring van damme or seagal this was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time,negative
first of all the reason im giving this film stars instead of is because at least peter falk gave his usual fantastic performance as lieutenant columbo he alone can get stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making moviei was initially all fired up at reading one posters comment that andrew stevens in this movie gave the performance of his career to me it was the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruined this movie and so was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment then thought to myself what else has stevens done so checked and you know that person was absolutely right in the years since this columbo movie was made apparently every one of the projects that stevens has been in since then has been utter crap so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his careerif you like columbo see every other of the titles before watching this one do yourself favor and save the worst for last,negative

have previously enjoyed wesley snipes in several action flicks and had expected lot more even from score of imdb the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic worst case scenario of playing strong feelings accompanied by some bad acting dont waist your time this movie ísnt entertaining if you wanna cry it might suffice though even though your tears will be wept due to seeing wesley snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedyi give this it really was awful if you wanna see decent movie go see shooter or rent it its all the good things this movie isnt,negative

what frustrating movie small southern town is overflowing with possibilities for exploring the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark underbellies hidden beneath placid surfaces as anyone who has read anything by carson mccullers already knows this does none of that instead the writers settled for cutesy twinkles cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama the thing looks like madefortv movie and was directed with no particular distinction but its hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interestingthe most frustrating aspect though is the fact that there are lot of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast all trying gamely to make the best of things and do what they can with thiswell theres no other word for itdrivel tragic waste of talent in particular that of the great stockard channing,negative
this movie starred totally forgotten star from the 1930s jack pearl radios baron munchausen as well as jimmy durante however decades later its being billed as three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pittsas for the stooges this is film from there very early daysbefore mgm had any idea what to do with the team at this point they were known as ted healy and his stooges as healy was the front man fortunately for the stooges they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man read up on himyoull see what mean and the rest is history within year they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team this sort of thing was common occurrence at mgm great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy such as the films of buster keaton laurel and hardy abbott and costello and others in fact up until they left for columbia mgm put them in wide variety of odd film rolesincluding acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady and oddly in this film they didnt act as teamthey just did various supporting roles such as larry playing the pianothis particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle when they are rescued and brought home all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like variety showpunctuated by scenes with the leads here and there as for pearl could really see why he never made successful transition to films as he has the personality of slug but slightly less welcome as for durante never knew what the public saw in himas least as far as his films are concernedhe was loud andloud he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keatons career to make this film together pearl and durante rely on lots of verbal humor and vaudevillestyle routines that tend to fall rather flatin this film the stooges they didnt yet have the right chemistry seeing healy doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd what they did in the film was pretty good but because all the segments were short they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines stooges fans might be very frustrated at this though diehard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their lifelong goal of seeing everything stoogeeven the rotten joe derita and joe besser films oh and did they got bad after the deaths of shemp and curlyoverall the film is rather dull and disappointing however there are couple interesting things to look for in the mess at about the minute mark you will see brief scene where tour guide on bus is singing look carefully as this is walter brennan in role youd certainly never expect another unusual thing to look for in the film is the clean as whistle song starting at about minutes into the film this song and dance number is clearly an example of socalled precode scene that never would have been allowed in films after when the production code was strengthened despite the word clean in the title its very titillating number with naked women showing lots of fleshenough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything its quite shocking when seen today though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s finally at the minute mark see jimmy durante set race relations back few decades see the film youll see that mean,negative

one of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history zodiac killer offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers the filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer and anyone who remembers zodiac will be intrigued others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal unlike many serial killers zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and selfpromoter the director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off the film is constructed as murder mystery or cold casestyle thriller it is an intelligent investigativeproceduralstyle horror film that will putoff gorehounds in search of cheap thrillssome people dislike any movie that is shot on video this attitude is very oldstyle and provincial it is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value these attitudes are on the way out zodiac killer is lowbudget film no doubt but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find carefullycrafted gem,positive
ive read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie real life eg what it takes to get into music school britney bashing etc etc so lets focus on the movie and the messagei have rated this movie out of for the age range to years and for family movie for the average adult male out of 10i like poprock music im know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until read the credits and these reviews didnt recognise her poster on the wall so was not worried about any self promotioni watch movies to be entertained dont care about casting lighting producers directors etc what is the movie and does it entertain mei watched this movie for the message the worlds greatest epidemic is low selfesteem which is whole other story so watched with the message in mind as that is an area of interest the movie is light bright and breezy great for kids found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give updont give up message so yeh it was bit predictable great message thoughshould be more of themthis movie is great family movie but for bloke watching by himself get hannibal,positive
like this movie because it is fine work of cinema made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies it is filled with supersurfer greg nolls home movies and boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50year passion nevertheless it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory it is filled with artistic talent and athletic talent however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic surfers are not astronauts nor testpilots nor are they surgeonsperhaps or phdsagain perhaps it believes in the quest of the surfer it believes in the beauty of human goofiness it believes in the great gift of peace which comes from the cessation of war surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an hawaiian island attacked by japanese zeroes fifteen years before it celebrates the downtime of country which fought cold warinstead of hotwar with the russian socialists surfing is the ultimate narcissism it is dangerous but only slightly historical suspect alexander the great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique he had to go out and conquer few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received this movie has no military heroes it has no guns the only beachhead surfers conquer has beerstand and and surfboard shop this is not problem peace is not desperate it is the joy of exhalation,positive

this movie was so badly written directed and acted that it beggars belief it should be remade with better script director and casting service the worst problem is the acting you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished professional and totally believable and on the other hand richard who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning and keeping couple although both normally do fine work the actors and director should not have attempted to do accents at allthey are inconsistent and unbelievable much better to have concentrated on doing good job in actual english the casting is ludicrous why have children of an african merchant thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society been cast with very pale skinned actors while the supposedly socially desirable marcel has pronounced african features including an obviously dyed blond fro its as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color its just so weird this could be great movie and should be remade but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors there are plenty of good actors out there and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast good script and decent direction,negative

steve mcqueen has certainly lot of loyal fans out there he certainly was charismatic fellow one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew but even mcqueen cant save this turkey of film shot with what looks like brownie camera in the actual locations in st louismcqueens new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of bank heist by one of the other gang theres more than broad hint that theres gay relationship going on between young steve and david clarke hes not liked at all by the other heist members mainly because of his lack of criminal resume steve also has girl friend in molly mccarthy and she suspects something afoot especially when he starts hanging around with crahan denton and james dukas as well as clarke all pretty rough characters that would certainly get my suspicions arousedthe great st louis bank robbery had two directors charles guggenheim and john stix guggenheim did mostly documentaries and stix didnt do much of anything one of those two jokers decided steves performance was best served by doing bad marlon brando imitation this film may go down as the worst ever done by steve mcqueen im willing to bet that dick powell and four star productions had already signed him for wanted dead or alive because cant believe they would have if they saw thisor they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey,negative
this is bad film as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts as result it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not film miss dunne or mr huston should have been proud of making however the film is worth watching if you are fan of precode films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls do put outeven if they arent married and even if their partner is the film begins with miss dunne as social worker assisting troops heading to europe for wwi in the process she meets scalawag bruce cabot who eventually convinces her to sleep with him she becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman however miss dunne does not want him back as she realizes hes not worth it but later her baby dies at child birth while all these very controversial plot elements are used they are always alluded toalmost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way kids in the audience will be clueless after all films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this timesurprisingly this entire plot involving stillborn baby and cabot ends about of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to it was as if they filmed part of movie and abandoned ittacking it on to still another film in this second phase of the film miss dunne unexpectedly begins working at womens prison though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there what we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate and as result of all this violence miss dunne goes on crusade to clean up the prison and becomes reformer and famous writerbut then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the womens prison reform business goes by the wayside dunne meets judge walter huston who is married but he desperately wants her now throughout the film dunne is portrayed as very good girleven though she did have unmarried sex with cabot she was more or less tricked into it but now single irene who is tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with married man he tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only but she never thinks to investigate if this is true and with his assurance off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business but while shes pregnant with his love child hes indicted for being crooked judge he assures her hes innocent but hes convicted and it sure sounds like hes scoundrelusing inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass fortune then in the final moments of the film miss dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until huston is released the film then endsso we basically have three separate films and bizarre early 30s idea of what nice girl should be like gathered that she should be strongminded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships this really undoes all the positives about dunnes character and its really hard to imagine anyone liking the film strong womens rights advocate might easily be offended at how weakminded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect with decent rewrite this could have been good film or at least interesting as lewd and salacious film but it couldnt make up its mind what it wanted to be and was just another dull precode film,negative

very mild spoilers basic plot outline no real details if you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations saw this film at free screening few days ago in maryland and the only reason agreed to gowas because it was free expected few chuckles but as have never been huge fan of tenacious not much more then thatthe first ten minutes of the film are hilarious as we are given look at jack blacks humble christian origins in midwest american town the film then takes us years into the future to the first meeting between jb and kyle gass the second half of tenacious we see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name finally as the title suggests the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled pick of destiny again the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny and most of the movie at least kept smile on my face that said there were times it felt bit long its only minutes but it still felt like it should have been bit shorter the story is every bit as absurd as it sounds and this is not film you see if you want real plot which is fine except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or missand when they miss they miss bad same thing with the songs it is musical but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or sothen kept going anywayi will say that the rrating really saved this movie from bombing the ds humor simply couldnt work without cussing sex and drug references but unless youre real fan of the band or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy would recommend you save yourself some money and rent pick will make you giggle bitbut is it worth bucks dont think so was tempted to rate it but since do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres seems more appropriate just be sure its your style,positive
shall begin with disclaimer this movie is not recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played ff7 the game before watching the movie relies on the audiences knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements and it does so very subtly do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of cg film and promise itll be that much betterwith that in mind this film has some of the most spectacular cg sequences have ever witnessed the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game on steroids yeah the attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action oriented ones is so impeccable it left me with sense of awei believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music again for those who are familiar with the ff7 story and background the music should not surprise anyone although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animationonce again myself having only played through ff7 once thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from square enix and that is the feel in most scenes choreographed and organized like dancein short if you enjoyed the music or the game final fantasy this film will blow you out of the water if youre in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as ff7 on playstation or pc doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experiencefinally just want to make note of the quality in animating this film characters move with fluidity each scene background comes to life and tells its own story for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot urge you to reexamine the animation facial reactions subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot deliverysquare enix and the great tetsuya nomura has set new bar for quality animation and storytelling advent children has ushered in new era for cg animations allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselvesthanks square enix the wait was well worth it,positive

things to come is an early scifi film that shows an imagined world or everytown through years you can break it up into about different scenes or parts the film spans from to and is mainly about how this ruler or the boss wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again after everytown was bombed and war broke outthis film only has about faults its audio is muddy and video had some quirks the characters arent deep at all and the overall plot isnt altogether solid the plot is lacking something that cant put my finger on it just seems little fluffy but if you love scifi and are interested in what hg wells though might happened in the next hundred years this is must see its worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing long drawnout war because they were just about to go to war with germany and there was threat of biological weapons and everythingthings to come is pretty good movie that most people need to see once,positive

this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features good cast of british actors so what went wrong dont know and simply dont care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish but apparently need to write ten lines of text in this review so might as well detail the plot nob of man is setup by his evil friend and coworker out of his fathers company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid very stupid plot twistsdevices should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience if you want good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather what about lock stock thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film,negative

this movie is riot cannot remember the last time had such great time at the movies ive seen few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny but this one is wall to wall great lines think best in show is the last movie that laughed so hard and so much in the movie was nonstop until the end when they did the minutes of sentimental plot clean up other than that its constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations id like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you dont get all the jokes the first time around you have to see it two or three times to get it all inas far as the actual film goes it could have used better edit its choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that all the characters are great its not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke think will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable no victims in this movie also thank god they got year old actress to play his girlfriend catherine keener plays her and she is sweetheart in this film you just wish that women like her really existed shes not like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbiteif you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it assure you the trailer does not do it justice they do not give away all the good jokes just some of the mediocre onesoh and one more thing hope critics put this on their top ten list many of them complain that comedies dont get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they dont put it on their list this means you ebert,positive
fey story of martian attempt to colonize earth things must be pretty bad back on mars two state troopers investigate the scene of reported ufo crash whatever landed is buried under the ice at tracys pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to nearby dinerthe diner has had no customers since eleven oclock that morning now there are handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross structurally weak bridge the bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus although he didnt notice who they were the problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to be resumed one of them is an alien but which one all of them are suspect theres the crazy old man jack elam of course who seems to exercise sub rosa wit theres blustering businessman who must get to boston john hoyt young couple on their honeymoon execrable performance by the husband ron kipling except for the couples nobody has noticed anyone else and even the couples are suspicious of each other bride to newly minted husband could have sworn you had mole on your chin the story continues in sprightly but slightly spooky way the phone rings for no reason the lights go on and off the juke box turns itself on and none of it is to be taken seriouslyits thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth chuckle there is no discernible depth to it its not moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens its not warning of any kind just fairy tale that diverts and amusesi always enjoy it when its on its especially interesting to see john hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman knowing that in he was the roman senator who masterminded the assassination of julius caesar in mgms version of shakespeares play and here he is with three armsoops,positive
its rare that feel need to write review on this site but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created and how bias its product wasi felt distinct attempt on the part of the filmmakers to display the palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy we hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression yet the film is shot and arranged in way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the jewish israeli population we see no evidence that parallels the position of the palestinian teenager we only hear from other palestinians in prison understand restrictions are in place but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peacei came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence so to speak she continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bombers parents and her angry and closedminded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control it is more realistic in my mind to see the israeli mindset to be root of the problem ignored pleas for understanding and freedom ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the jewish population acquired the landi have given this two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother which normally would be admirable in documentary however in the light of the lack of impartiality it all seems exploitative also for the poor edits lack of background in the actual instance and finally the lack of proper representation of the palestinian side ultimately it is poor documentary and poor film acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heartwrenching and sad subject matter,negative
relentless like one of those loud action movies the entire cast seems to be on speed didnt quite get the directors intentions if any wonder if shes ever seen stanley donen vincent minnelli or even george sidney musical structure please this is one hell of mess and loved abba the costumes the unflattering photography unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations the one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of meryl streep making fool of herself no chemistry with her friends christine baranski and julie walters think of streep with lily tomlyn in the altman film and youll understand what was hoping for was embarrassed in particular by pierce brosnam and colin firth the audience however seemed to enjoy it so it probably its just me,negative

an extremely downtoearth well made and acted rodeo western no gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling real life story about rodeo hustler and his entourage in the 60s and 70s west but hats off particularly to slim pickens for giving what think was his signature performance especially given the fact that he had been rodeo clown in real life his role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the ups and downs of the hardnosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such life style he and mr coburn teamed up extremely well as partners not only on the circuit itself but also in the real world outside the corral also check out anne archer as coburns native american love interest in the latter part of the movie must have been one of her first roles not as flashy perhaps as junior bonner but equally heart rendering and impacting in its portrayal thanks to the encore western channel for showing this true grit of an underrated movie from time to time,positive
despite some reviews being distinctly lukewarm found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as mills and boon so what it is good to see warm touching story of real love in these cynical times many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other even though for political reasons it was an arranged marriage did feel though that sir john conroy who was desperate to control the young queen is perhaps played too like pantomime villain as it is rumoured that he was in fact the real father of victoria as result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent it would have been interesting to explore this theory emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria great queen of england which prospered as never before under her long reign believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie,positive

first off have to say that loved the book animal farm read it with my 9th grade class and it was great we also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial the movie was so disappointing to me the movie cuts out some characters and misses lot of the main points of the book it skips around lot and doesnt explain anything in detail if someone was watching this movie without having first read the book they would be confused the most disappointing thing in this movie to me was the ending the ending in the book was the most powerful and in the movie they changed it it was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of melting together but instead the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs to sum up dont think that this movie captured the real meaning that orwell portrayed in his book,negative
this movie was extremely boring only laughed few times decided to rent it when noticed william shatners name on the cover its all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates when wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist he meets prostitute she takes him to club called the playground where he befriends several pimps when mayor tony gold shatner decides to take over the pimp business lil pimp must lay down for his homiesthe animation isnt very good in this it looks like it was made with macromedia which im sure it was it doesnt suck its just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years the humor in this is not very good didnt think any of it was funny,negative
was disgusted by this movie no it wasnt because of the graphic sex scenes it was because it ruined the image of artemisia gentileschi this movie does not hold much truth about her and her art it shows one piece of art work that she did judith beheading holofernese but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first judith for year after the triali dont know if you understood this from the movie probably not tassi was not noble character he raped artemisia it was not love it was rape he did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured according to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew artemisia aka had sex with while she states over and over again its truei encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she is really about dont base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie encourage you to do some research artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art workdont see the movie but find out the true story of artemisia,negative
such joyous world has been created for us in pixars bugs life were immersed in universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film but more precisely universe which could only be documented through the world of animation for those who have forgotten what plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer when its in the right hands that is bugs life is warm reminder we walk out of the film with an equallywarm feeling and sense of satisfaction derivative of only highcalibre film productionsit is only pixars second animated feature the subgroup of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in with their landmark movie toy story it was movie which defied convention reinvented and breathed new life into animation and defined whole new level of excellence now they return with their sophomore effort which to be honest draws creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the filmafter all its film about ants well all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in bugs life but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film as humans are the focal point in dramas romances and so on how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of movie let alone provide the entire premise of feature film surely they jest however we forget that in toy story bunch of toybox items were able to become the grandest most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat and manage to turn bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin youll probably ever encounternot only are they all entirely amiable and likable there isnt an unpleasant character in sight even the villains are riveting characters but theyre colourful theyre eclectic and theyre idiosyncratic and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of better term only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto bugs life from the beginning we shall start with our main character and our hero his name is flik david foley and his character is rather generic to say the least out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush beautiful ant island he is the one considered the black sheep of the clan as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the seasons harvest with his anticsthe problem arises in the fact that the ants harvest is for bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper kevin spacey who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone they go insane for lack of better term hopper offers proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his packs hands however its negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil the cogs and clockwork in fliks mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colonys rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppersif you think about it bugs life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot lines of akira kurosawas classic seven samurai or the american remake the magnificent seven in which village of hapless but goodhearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies one lone villagedweller goes in search for help in the big city finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil in bugs life the help comes in the form of downandout circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in barroom brawlmuch amusement comes out of these scenes and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs among them are an erudite stick insect david hyde pierce sidesplitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and quasifemme fatale ladybug whos in fact gritty and masculine ladybug dennis hopper its exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs onscreen as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact onscreen as is the entire movie collectivelyas ive said much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another which give way to bevy of hilarious lines wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall dazzling movie what makes bugs life even better is that the film isnt restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film the clichéd kidfriendly situations are bit more abundant than wed like however its easy to ignore this fault and its incredulously easy to enjoy this filmalthough bugs life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor this is still superb movie and the start of something promising here pixar have proved that theyre not just onehit wonder but instead muchgifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood they raise the bar endlessly and when someone always manages to top their standards its only always by themselves what more is there to say about bugs life other than see it its not quite the best which weve seen from the folks at emeryville california but this beats out the lot of its year and ill be damned if this isnt the best animated feature

what an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original this version is no different felt that the ralph fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of juliette brioche as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision everanyway back to this version it aims to make the story relevant to contemporary setting and in musical style it succeeds in both but high art it is nit throwaway viewing for rainy day maybethe direction was average and the editing abysmal worse than the old quincy deepak verma does great turn as hindley and is in fact one of britains wasted talents the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and think that the casting is the strongest point of this project although more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had its clear that he was director for hire and didnt instill the project with the passion that it deserved,negative
my father the hero used to be my favorite movie when was younger its about andre divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter katharine heigl on vacation hoping to get little closer to her but of course nicole isnt that easy to get along with she just started puberty im guessing she is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him hard time one day at the beach nicole meets handsome ben and she makes up wild story about her and her dad the whole island gets involved and the movie turns into hilarious wild entertaining movie would give my father the hero,positive
it is surprising that production like this gets made these days especially for television considering the strong sexual themes and explicit lovemaking scenes not to mention lesbianism this has been given superb treatment and directionthe sets and costumes are flawless the direction is stylish and the characters are likeable there is fair amount of humor but it has surprisingly dark interludes the protagonist is really tragic figure but not devoid of happiness also this production avoids the mistake most filmsshows make when dealing with homosexualitylesbianism the characters are very human it seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on tv and movies most shows fill it full of cliches and make the characters obsessed with being gay not so with this in tipping the velvet the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian meansthe bbc have made some wonderful productions in the past and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts,positive
just dont get some of the big premises of this episode that miranda is so remarkable and that theres anything so ugly it would make you insane someone here made the remark that maybe its the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness miranda is just jerk the episode is slow inconsistent and way too talky also dont quite understand why kolos is an ambassador why doesnt the federation just leave the damn medusans be theres one part do like when kolos is speaking through spock about the loneliness of the human experience overall love tos and even at its lamest ill always tune in this episode though mmm wouldnt purchase it except for used copy under,negative
this is one of my all time favorite movies and would recommend it to anyone on my list of favorite movies mental list mind the only ones on par with it are movies such as the lord of the rings series spirited away and fly away homei can really relate to the main character jess at the start of the movie shes shy girl with slightly odd background who has lot more friends who are boys than that are girls she really sucks you into her life also certainly cant fault any of the protagonists acting or anyone elses in the filmthe soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules the movie is never boring the romance is really cute and didnt make me blush tooooo hard one thing that really made it though was the indian factor jess parents are indian and there are many colourful indian conventions throughout the film providing very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else the indian people are also hilarious essentially this is coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for itfeel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film theyre funny theyre refreshing and they make you feel good,positive

this animation has very simple and straightforward good vs evil plot and is all about action what sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around her movements were done so well why dont they use this rotoscopic technique more these days its quite effectivefire and ice in its prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy others including plenty of women will adore its esthetic quality for sure did not mind bakshi just loves animating lushious voluptuous babes as can also be seen in cool world and dont think he has to apoligize since its pretty much animation for adults but had also enjoyed this animation as child and never forgot itthis one was just special so different from the standard disney or anime fare and for that reason alone well worth the watch since its possibly bakshis finest for those who like animations with lushious women try space adventure cobra as welli give fire and ice out of,positive

chinese ghost story iii is totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films the film delivers the spellcasting special effects that one can expect but fails painfully on all other fronts the actors all play extremely silly caricatures you have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny the plot is predictable and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow towards the end the movie begins to resemble old godzilla films including shabby largerthanlife special effects and well yet another ghost with godzilla head maybe would have grinned if was expecting campit is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze little extra money out of successful formula they wont be able to do it again the cash cow is now dead as dodo,negative

if had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and queaseinducing dogme style would never have rented it nevertheless took dramamine for the seasickness and gave it shot lasted very very very long forty minutes before giving up its just boring pretentious twaddlethe last french movie saw was romance and it too was pretty dismal but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme overseas itll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy its called dogme because thats the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera,negative

first let me just comment on what liked about the movie the special effects were fantastic and very rarely did feel like was watching video game there that is the last nice thing have to say about this film in fact would just like everyone reading this to take note that cant even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing have innumerable complaints about the film but four major complaints jump to mind my first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the plot twist if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming mile away where loiss yearold son turns out to be the superpowered child of superman when the crying superchild throws piano at lexs henchman to save his mother almost got up and left the theater singer could have made much better superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like seemingly fragile but latently superpowered illegitimate child its been days since saw the movie and still want to vomit my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space it doesnt take comic book guy from the simpsons to point out whats wrong with that dont know how many comic books brian singer has read but when superman is exposed to even small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet whoever had the idea to have him fly large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any supermanrelated projects ever again the concept is as ridiculous as making dracula movie where the title character has stake through his heart and still manages to fly spaceship made out of garlic into the sun why not just have superman eat kryptonite he can eat it and then brush his teeth with it and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas thats not any more absurd then having him hoist continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in reentry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground my third major complaint has to do with the fact that singer slaps moviegoers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie have to take issue with his characterization of superman as the only son of godlike jorel sent to earth to be savior jorel wasnt allwise he was just scientist and he didnt send his son to earth to be savior he threw him in rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode ill buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god sends christ to earth because heaven was about to explode and then radioactive pieces of heaven become christs primary weakness furthermore the crucifixion scene where luthor stabs superman in the side with kryptonite spear just makes me want to slam my face into brick until im too braindead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future they might as well rename this movie superman returns the passion of the christand speaking of luthor my last major complaint has to do with singers depiction of lex luthor lex luthor is shrewd coldhearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for president which he does in the comics than try to destroy the world the man wants money and power he wants to be in charge not wreck everything yet the luthor we see superman returns as well as all the previous superman movies is wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world if singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the quite awful previous superman movies this film might not be such an unbearable travesty maybe singers next project can be batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of batman from 1960s tv show zam whap powto summarize dont know what hate more the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews everyone is entitled to their opinion but if you dont hate this movie then your opinion is wrong sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you havent already dont see it dont buy it when it comes out on dvd dont rent itbasically dont contribute any money towards it in any way this movie does not deserve to make any money in fact think that for every person that sees this movie bryan singer should be fined billion dollars if youre superman fan and you really want to see this movie just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and youll get the same experience without having to waste hours of your time,negative
this is one of the best tv productions of musical ever have heard the merman cast album the angela lansbury album have seen tyne daly live and ive seen the rosalind russell movie countless times think bette is if not the best then tied with the best she captures not just the bravura but also the pathos of mama rose was never natalie wood fan so really enjoyed cynthia gibb in what is arguably her best role everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful the three strippers led by the alwaysdependable christine ebersole are hard to top there was supposed to be tv production of mame few years back with cher but think bette would be the best bet pun intended for auntie mame,positive
am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad it reminds me of cgrade porn movie with one major difference no pornthe story and dialogue needs complete overhaul maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable at the very least the pacing should have been picked upwhile accept that this had low budget and the director did good job visually given what little resources he had he should have spent more time on the story or better yet get someone else to write it many of the action scenes were just pointlessit was complete waste of my time,negative
is it perfect movie no it is weird adaptation from scifi book and it features vampires from space naked beauties and the british army efficiencywhen first saw this movie was rather young and all can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and mathilda may actually if it werent for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie probably wouldnt have rated it so high but given her sheer magnificence am now actually considering voting it uplucky for me got reminded of the movie and watched it again now imagine raiders of the lost ark or poltergeist special effects splattered unto rather decent scifi story but with completely over the top performances still enjoyed the movie tremendously as well as mathilda may but it was mixture of nostalgia comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it endedbottom line if you are scifi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie oh and did mention mathilda may is young beautiful and naked,positive
overall was rather impressed with the pilot the initial first fifteen minutes were worrying as it did feel the creators were trying to create science fiction version of the oc but this fear is rectified when terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that very rarely see television tacklebsg dealt with themes such as monotheism existentialism reality death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and personally found myself evoking such works as ghost in the shell and the matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed think if you are fan of the two just mentioned or other filmstelevision shows which deal with the subjects referenced think you will find at least something herein terms of starting point to explain how the situation we know in bsg came about believe they handled it in very interesting way especially liked how they explained where the cylons belief in one god came from and the creation of caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewersthe only real weak points noticed were the relationship between the greystone parents and the actress who plays lacy rand while like eric stoltz and paula malcomson individually together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters but this is something think needs work also found magda apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role this again could be down to experience and time needed to develop but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confidentbased on the pilot greatly look forward to seeing where caprica goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that bsg once did,positive
im the type of guy who loves hood movies from new jack city to baby boy to killa season from the grade to the hollywood but this movie was something different am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable but some bits were just weird well the acting wasnt to good compared to silkk the shockers performance in hot boyz quite good and icet in new jack and svu great the scene where corrupt icet kills the wanna be jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both icet and the other dude this kills the jamaican however icet is unharmed very similar to ices other movie urban menace which stars both of these actors were snoops character is supernatural however after this there is nothing suggested that corrupt is like demon when mj silkk gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thighwith out blood and when mj confesses killing cop cos the cop was beating up his friend benny was weird benny isnt introduced in this movie and the scene isnt in the film it does hold weight to the fact why corrupt wants to kill mj but is still makes scratch your head wen jody writes letter to miss jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesnt mention what happen other main characters mj and lisa the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghettowhich plagues the lives of latinos and blacks word widewas good part of the film even though the clip of the projects was reused thousands of times and the scene where miles kills the latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed not wearing helmet and running into my latino brothers car would of killed him the movie was similar to the film urban menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team it was ok tho but me being from poverty love hood films however if dont love em like do dont watch it only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie made which was made with dollars and my love of the genrenathaniel purez,negative
am huge fan of the farcry game huge fan it still holds place in my top10 games list of all time the story line was new fresh truly brilliant foundation to base movie on or so thoughtfarcry the movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on successful game franchise see doom the movie and many morethe video game begins as the player jack carver awakes in sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an rpg from an unknown soldier jack then finds communication device where harlan doyle guides him across islands shipwrecks jungles installations and volcanoes to find his lady friend valerie constantine all the wile battling mutated super soldiers and genetically enhanced animalsthe movie plays out very very differently theres needless mins of the movie of backstory before we even get to the boat blowing up scene jack then walks onto the beach kills some goons then drives off nothing like the game there is no communicator with doyle on the other end the modified soldiers look like albinos with singlets on and there was no mutated monkeylike creatures jumping out of the bushes part of the farcry game enjoyed allot there is no sun filled beach scenes no aircraft carrier no communications stations on huge cliffs little reference to any ingame contents charactersitemsvehicles in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all the climactic volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building theres an ending scene where everyone except krieger live happily ever after what thei recommend avoiding this movie at all costs if you are gamer you will hate this movie will all your soul it is movie clearly intended for males so girls stay away so if your male years of age have never played farcry and are not disgusted by directors attempts at porting booksgames to the cinema then this is for you,negative

havent seen this movie in about years but it still haunts me when asked about my favorite films this is the one that seem to always mention first there are certain films works of art like this film dark city and breaking the waves that seem to touch place within you place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive that they make lifelong impression on the viewer not unlike lifechanging event such as the ending of serious relationship or the death of friend this film shook me when first saw it it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days,positive
today wrote this review in anger at uwe boll and hollywoodhollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation changed everything it changed our perception of security it changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity most importantly and devastatingly it changed our worldhowever cant not stress how utterly repulsed disillusioned and angry am at the careless blatant ignorance of hollywood seeking to make lucrative profit out of death and destruction this film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid wordofmouth among moviegoers and critics alike most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press hollywood has sunk to new low even lower than the lowdown bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty behind it all is uwe boll am very angry at this movie how dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost how dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy how dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on national tragedy in the mist of mourning and weary post911 world howdarethey to those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty say this with heavy heart with all my strength remember think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are sane and moral person think back to that day ask yourself whether or not this film is disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacksask yourself if you have soulthink remember respect the memories of the lives lost on by not seeing this film at all,negative
you cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed thats why movies like fast and the furious dhoom rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences especially local ones we live on tiny island and cannot fathom why for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system most of us want to get into debt by owning set of wheels which come with tax when they reach our shores and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one not only that the high end sports cars were once quipped by prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear lest they reach the seaand these movies are relatively easy to make hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic for once those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long cant compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these of course there are amongst us ahem those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models and movies such as these cannot do without leggy model in frame however they dont warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into park the guy sitting beside me swear he wet his pants every time his dream cars appear and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moansso there we have it the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie with the fast and the furious franchise the japanese models like the evos and the skylines take centerstage as does the gt here the ford gt takes on an incredibly droolworthy facade modification that even im impressed alongside the latest models like the ferrari enzos porshe carerra gts koenigsegg ccxs and every car out there that has wings for doors but seriously my heart goes out to the cars each time theyre mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment mean this are perfectly fine high performance models that are at the apex of motoring but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow they do so because they cantheres no story in redline just excuses to put together movie full of beauties the cars that is that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible and with the usual shots of pedals always the accelerator mind you tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy and earn you no respect steering wheels gear shifts always shifting up and not down all these while having the actors make pretend that theyre the baddest asses with an engine snarling and giving each other dirty looks not very tall order for an actor and thats why we get the most woeful performances ever with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkidsthe heroine yes it made statement that girls can drive natasha very plasticky looking nadia bjorlin is one of those million dollar finds girl with model looks who dont mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil who has racing pedigree within her and performs with rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable every line had to do with cars and when singing about love just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts lubricants and going for rides introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by gangsta called infamous eddie griffin she gets drawn into family squabbles involving leo dicaprio lookalike iraq war veteran and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle everything else well like said just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to raceand its almost always the same as theres very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars especially when you know the race is rigged for narrative reasons and can see the race outcome mile away from the finishing line while fast and furious had quite charismatic actors and will put my head on the chopping block by naming paul walker sun kang and of course the star it created vin diesel redline had none just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately it looks like tv movie in its treatment from the get go with very insipid opening sequence where its one man one car and minutes race against time to get to vegasif not for the cars then this movie seriously is piece of junk with bad acting bad lines and bad action strictly for the car fans or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines,negative
im the type of person who always goes to horror section when im picking film so picked five across the eyes was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy itit made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish think could of done better myself think that it was the worst film have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch think it was little bit like cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul,negative
seven ups has been compared to bullitt for the chase scene but does not come anywhere near matching bullitt bullitt has beginning that builds builds builds when mcqueen leaves the seedy hotel gets into his mustang which is parked under the embarcadero freeway now torn down and notices the charger sitting nearbye you know you are about to see something spectacular from that moment on when mcqueen starts that car begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed adding to it is terrific lalo schriffin if remember correctly sound track this goes on for long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing that shot of mcqueens mustang suddenly appearing in bill hickmans rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact hickmans look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect then of course san francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends also bullitt being filmed in the 60s when cars were still hot mustang gt and dodge charger made for better set of wheels then two boring smog device laden pontiacs in the 1970s seven ups bill hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the univeral lot when was doing movie reviews for paper they gave it good try in seven ups though with the chase scene seven ups had few jumps over little hills yawn but of course they were not san francisco hills the seven ups chase where they are actually going fast is longer than the go fast sequence in bullitt but the scene of single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood off of roy schieders pontiac is the height of absurdity strictly hollywood would say except that it was filmed in new york,positive
have you ever heard the saying that people telegraph their intentions well in this movie the characters actions do more than telegraph future plans they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced embeth davidtzs character is not mysterious just wooden and kenneth branagh doesnt succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to havethe bottom line obvious plot onenote performances unlikeable characters and grotesque southern accents employed by british actors,negative
night of the living homeless was fairly strong finish to the first half of season obviously parody of various zombie movies most notably dawn of the dead this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brainskyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he out of the goodness of his heart gives to homeless man in front of his house more homeless people begin to infiltrate south park until the town is completely overrun with them this is very strong randy marsh episode as he assumes the role of the shotgunwielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the park county community center but before randy makes it to the community center he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming dont have any change unfortunately the refugees end up losing gerald broflofski to the homeless when he tries to escape by catching bus out of town and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people then he becomes one of them asking everyone for changethe boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in south park and find man who is director of homeless studies they find out that the nearby city of evergreen used to have similar problem with the homeless so they escape to evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem unfortunately homeless people break into the mans house and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself however he fails several times as he shoots himself in the jaw in the eye in the chest in the neck in the shoulder screaming horribly until he finally dies this scene may have been funnier had similar scene not happened in fantastic easter special two weeks agomeanwhile member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem the property values have nosedived thus the bank has foreclosed on his house making him homeless randy immediately turns on him holding the gun to the mans head when the man finally begs the others for few bucks to help him out randy pulls the triggerin evergreen the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to south park and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country the boys modify bus that leads the homeless out of south park and takes them all the way to santa monica californiathe zombie movie parallels and the great randy marsh lines make this one definitely rewatchable,positive
im not sure who decides what category movie fits into but this movie is not horror movie as for the story it was fairly interesting but rather slow was especially disappointed with the ending thoughspoilertell me why on earth does she run over to her uncles home without at least calling the detective or the police first she knows exactly whats going on at that point plus she has video tape as proof instead she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying know everything have proof you didnt expect proof did you then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if hes going to harm her well duh of course hes going to harm you idiot you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything what dumb ending,negative

not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is paula sages touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline this gives the film feeling of real truth and makes you think youve seen something special710,positive
read the book before seeing the movie and the film is one of the best adaptations out there very true and faithful to the book sean penn and sarandon are amazing robbins is talented filmaker and wish he would add more to his repetoire he made the film very haunting and intentionally slowpaced to add depth an especially brilliant bit of filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end,positive
docteur petiot starring michel serrault is brutal story about brutal man doctor who heals the sick in occupied france even if their ability to compensate is not there yet he preys on the weakest amidst the populace the imagery and cinematography are superb and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story he is the perfect psychopath seductive and altruistic intelligent and caring calculating and murderous movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer kudos to mr serrault for his chilling portrayal,positive
just got this video used and was watching it last night the acting started out extremely bad heyheytwister but got very good soon after wards the tornadoes looked extremely fake and many of the cgi effects were very dodgy but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done and just about on par with movies like twister the scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too the story was very well written and its refreshing to see movie like this stray away from the same old disaster formulas movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for yearswhile this movie had very weird mix of fx and acting quality this merits an in my book,positive
this film is really vile it plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s80s and puts it into school context im not saying that urban crime wasnt problem for lot of people or that schools werentarent problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case its not case of social issues but white uppermiddle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol and of course he knows how to play the system does that sound familiar yes this turd is pure violent exploitation really nasty piece of work its disturbing brutality dressed up as social comment this belongs in the same category as trash like exterminator death wish and so on and so on the only remarkable thing is that michael fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this,negative

sixth escapade for freddy krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in springwood now he wants to broaden his horizons and spoiler needs family member in order to do ita failure as horror movie because it simply aint scary at all works better as dark macabre black comedy to tell you the truth freddy krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer too many wisecracks thats for sure the actors arent interesting save robert englund as always and an obviously slumming yaphet kotto and there are simply far too many visual effects the finale is ok but doesnt provide as many sparks as think one might hopein adding new twist to the familiar dream killers story it provides englund the opportunity to do more nonmakeup scenes than ever beforethere are cameos worth noting joint cameo by thencouple roseanne and tom arnold that is devoid of entertainment value an appropriate appearance by veteran shockrocker alice cooper and funny cameo by johnny depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had becomefilm debut of breckin meyer who plays spencerone of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits410,negative
ok im italian but there arent so many italian film like this think that the plot is very good for of the film but the final is too simple too predictable but its the only little mistake the consequences of love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack id like very much the lighting work on it the best thing on it is great great actor you know if your name were al pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance but its only great theater italian actor called toni servillo yes someone tell me this film and this kind of performance its too slow its so boring so many silences but think that this components its fantastic its the right way for describing the love story between very talented young girl the granddaughter of the italian actress anna magnani olivia and the old mysterious man toni one of my favorite italian films,positive
if you only see one ernest movie in your life make it this one this is by far the best in the series with its nonstop laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages the other ernest flicks were good too but most people tend to get tired of him quickly not me howeverin this movie ernest whorrel is assigned jury duty for murder case the murderer nash just happens to look exactly like our bumbling hero ernest mr nash finds this good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identities with him and so we get to see how ernest reacts in the slammera great flick if you havent already seen it watch it,positive

the first cube movie was an art movie it set up world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented and showed how they struggled to make sense of hostile world that they couldnt understand it was on the nonliteral level man vs cruel nature plot where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end triumphing to face new indefinable world beyond mans petty squabbles world where there were no more struggle but peace rated cube out of and its movie that was never meant to have any sequelsthe second movie hypercube was massive disappointment some of the ideas were kind of cool but in the context of the original movie both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning still for being fairly entertaining rated it out of 10the third movie cube zero while ignoring the second plays like vastly inferior commercial bmovie rehash of the first sans the symbolism there is no homage or tribute here there is only ripping off the same kind of plot with some elements idiotically altered like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is ripoff with absolutely no originality and nothing to saythat we see something from behind the scenes means nothing because the watchers are just part of the big bad experiment the architects of which we hear nothing of and in this movie those who get through to the exit like kazan did at the end of the first movie are just killed where the bleep is the sense in that thats just flippin stupid im glad didnt pay to see thisthe production values and acting in cube zero are not too bad but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me rating of out of,negative
have just watched this movie on dvd late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was good joke for the audience in other words the creators planed to make comedy not drama howsoever at the end realized that mr tony giglio was earnest about this movie its pity because the dialogue is ridiculous the acting is poor and lifeless the story is fishy tale poor ryan phillippe despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance what to say for jason statham lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction for this reasons vote,negative
believe shakespeare explained what just read beautifully me thinks he the lady doth protest too much the whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself he sites profane literature writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible number of times however can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible anyone can skew data prove anything they like but it doesnt make it true customs change word definitions change over time look at english german where it is very obviously common root nothing stays the same its always growing and changing the bible has many different translations but the king james version is the one ive found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research in the king james version you will notice there are certain words written in italics these words have been added by the translators and can be dropped the mean of the entire verse changes writings from around the time of christ were written without spaces without punctuation without paragraphs without numeric verses these writings look like one long word the translators added all of the above for example how would you read this godisnowhere do you read it as god is nowhere or do you read it as god is now here same string of letters two entirely different meanings this is why many biblical researchers use lexicon to assist them in translation as it provides word for word translation from the original arabic greek or hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written its also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove god exists but you can not prove he doesnt exist in the end just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty talk about ego putting soapbox away god bless maegi,negative

response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed one person suggested that the closing and destruction of the ocean view amusement park led to downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods this is simply not true prior to the construction of interstate which bypasses the ocean view area the primary route for traffic went through the heart of ocean view once the interstate was completed ocean view rapidly became ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime this led to huge reduction in revenues for the park which also faced new competition from nearby busch gardens in williamsburg meanwhile in the past few years the city of norfolk has done remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become soughtafter location for construction of highend housingit has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film rollercoaster this is also untrue footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to death of ocean view parkas to the film itself the storyline of supernatural force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly but somewhat typical for bgrade movies of the time with the cast involved there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors dont believe this film was intended to be another citizen kane believe playboy was experimenting with new nonnude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into apparently not strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table but proved unmanageable in execution the roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway lets come up with weird way to justify an explosive demisefor the casual movie viewer this would be see once and forget about it film except for diana canova fans but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park this movie is like walk down memory lane for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown norfolk the first harborfest and old dominion university even limited release of this film on dvd would be welcome,negative
was expecting lot from mramitabh bachans role of sarkar but am disappointed being ram gopal vermas direction was not ready for this kind of movie sarkar is supposed to be strong character but the movie shows that amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his there is movie in tamil called nayakan based on the theme of god father and kamala hassan has played the lead the movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of kamala hassan not his son amitabh bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things the movie fails to show the strong impact of god father,negative

went to see passion of mind because usually get kick out of the genre of alternate reality romances ie sliding doors me myself etc but this was the worst one ive ever seen had to force myself to sit through it didnt even stay through the credits which is unheard of for methe magical realism was completely missing because demi moore was grim and the lovers she was twotiming were guys who usually play villains though each was kind of sexy and appealingthere was actually psychological explanation provided for the dual lives with distasteful frisson of the elektra complex maybe the magic shouldnt be explained for this genre to workoriginally written,negative
thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotionalespecially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie personally like the empire strikes back lot also but think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slowermoving was not as episodic and just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as did with the third movieit also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as whole have heard many strange reasons such as because yoda died because bobba fett died because small ewoks defeated band of stormtroopers because darth vader was revealedi would like to debunk each of these reasons because believe that they miss the point completely first off who cares if bobba fett died if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die dont get me wrong am fan of bobba fett but he made few cameo appearances and it was not lucas intention to make him central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fetts name judging rotj because minor character died is bit much think secondly many fans did not like yoda dying sure it was momentous period in the movie was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic all the good guys cant stay alive in realistic movie you know otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to cheesy saturday morning cartoon another aspect to this point about people not liking yodas death well nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in new hope many consider new hope to be the best of the trilogy why was obi wans death okay but yodas not hmmmmmmmmmmmm another reason just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible that is utterly ridiculous can not believe this one first off the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage since you lived in the forest all your life hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage they had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest the only thing they had was their blasters to add it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated combination of the star wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been great upset lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you how about in empire strikes back or in new hope where there were several scenes of group consisting of just han solo chewbacca and the princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view and not only that the heroes of course always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters the troopers must have very very bad aim then at least in empire strikes back the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not heroes against legion of stormtroopers dont believe me check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping landos base or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at somehow they missedas han solo and luke were trying to exit the death starthe last reason that care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like darth vader being revealed well in many ways that was major part of the plot in the movie luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father annakin skywalker it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his fathers face because it made it complete by annakins revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was annakin skywalker by removing the helmet the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about in fact thats is what would have done in that scene too if were lukes fatherisnt that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in mechanized helmeton another note think subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves never go into film with that deception in mind always try to go into film with the attitude that well it might be better or worse that the original but can not know for sure lets see that way go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that clearly superior film is not as good as it really wasi am not sure who criticizes these movies but have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that new hope was their favorite that it is rotj believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleadingbottom line the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its minutes there was not moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above for example the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any dayfinally hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as this movie stinks because luke is not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately,positive
crossfire remains one of the best hollywood message movies because unlike the admirably intentioned gentlemans agreement which it beat to theatres by few months it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying its because im jewish isnt it its much easier to get the message that hate is like loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical somewhat shamefully the brief featurette on the warners dvd doesnt mention that novelist richard brooks disowned the film over the shift from homophobic murder to an antisemitic one but its interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is jewish theres little doubt in sam levenes performance that the character is in fact also gay not mincing caricature but theres definitely two lost souls aspect to his scenes with george coopers confused soldier theres not much of mystery to who the murderer is even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guytheres an element of ealing films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of fix you could almost see that aspect as blueprint for hue and cry but the atmosphere is pure rko noir set over one long sweltering night the film has great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style it cut back on lighting time and allowed director edward dmytryk more time to work with the actors and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script laidback but quietly charismatic robert mitchum robert youngs maigretlike detective gloria grahames tramp and the perpetually creepy paul kelly as her compulsive liar admirer guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties but the lasting impression is of robert ryans excellent performance as guy who could do with good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row big surprise hit in as reward dmytryk and producer adrian scott found themselves investigated by the huac which itself had notable tendency to target jews so much for crusading,positive
this movie basically is very well made production and gives good impression of war situation and its effects on those involved its always interesting to see the story from the other side for change this movie concentrates on group of german soldiers who after fighting in the north africa campaign are send to stalingrad russia where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of ww ii is being foughtits interesting to see the other side of this battle since we mainly just always see the germans simply as the villains in this movie those villains are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who youre fighting against at first its kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the germans are the evil villains but of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care and be interested in themthe way this story is told isnt however the best its hard to keep track of the story at times as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other the movie isnt always logic in its storytelling and features bit too many sequences that remain too vague it also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who it doesnt always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one just not the most coherent one around in that regard hollywood movies are always better than european moviesthe production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations though the movie wasnt even shot in russia itself it helps to create good war time situation atmospherethe character are mostly interesting although perhaps tad bit formulaic but dont know for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism it also helps that theyre being played by well cast actors all of the actors arent the best known actors around thomas kretschmann was also at the time still fairly unknown actor but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personalityall in all not the best or most consistent ww ii drama around but definitely worth look due to its original approach of the german side of the battle of stalingrad and its good production values710,positive
so rented this from netflix because somebody gave me roger eberts book hated hated hated this movie and he gave this one rare zerostar rating in the book and said at the end of his original review mad dog time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor so figured from ebert saying that would see if it was really as bad as he said it was know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but could not express how much hated this piece of junk like ebert did and never since eberts review of rob reiners north where he said he hated that movie ten times had ever heard such brilliant hatred movie review here we have richard dreyfuss as gangster which dont think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss as gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well but above all the other things that were awful about this movie can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all while the movie starts off with jeff goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching dreyfusss girlfriend while dreyfuss was at criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits but after that first or minutes the other minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for seconds then someone gets shot then there are whole bunch of jokes about dreyfuss being mentally ill haha not funny then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying frank sinatras my way sang by gabriel byrne apparently to insult dreyfuss of course because the screenplay was written on the level of sixth grader dreyfuss shoots byrne over five times and byrne just will not die are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny can certainly tell you did not care or find that funny not only am disappointed in dreyfuss who admire much as an actor for producing and starring in this tripe but am also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum because this was released the same year that independence day was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history did goldblum feel that independence day would be flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if independence day were bomb what did an oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this the opening sequence of mad dog time says that the movie is set on another planet only wish now that have wasted minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of minutes out of my life that will never get back ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough am afraid every copy of mad dog time should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire have yet to top worst movie have ever seen because this one has won its honor as the worst movie ever,negative
what boring film to sum it all up its was basically just nana patekar beating up his daughterinlaw karisma kapoor while she tried to flee from the village with her son can someone say boring the concept wasnt too bad but it was poorly executed the canadian locales and some of the village scenes were nicely shot however overall the cinematography came up short the story could have been great but the movie just seemed to drag on there is only so much stupidity person can take let alone three bloody hours of itthe best part of the whole movie was the song ishq kamina and that was only five minutes long other than that this movie was piece of crap,negative
rant start didnt want to believe them at first but guess this is what people are talking about when they say south korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill after the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie gwoemul aka the host of which actually succeeded in making sharp satire out of bmovie genre successive korean blockbusters have become more and more generic even though their budgets mainly spent on special effects have become more and more fantastic do south korean moviemakers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill which their industry has built up since the breakout film shiriswiri by making whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland china did rant endthe only reason can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of korean east asianstyled dragon have seen to date for the final scenes now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the dragonheart the movie might have had few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons remember dungeons dragons in hasnt anyone learnt that the trick is not how much special effects you use but how well you use it hope there are more and better korean legends they can use because they have just killed lot of international interest in korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this onein short agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how koreans felt about having their folk anthem arirang being played at the very end as creature feature would have given it at least stars out of if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it but ive seen many video games with better camera work and scripting just less dragons,negative

remember watching this series avidly every saturday evening it was the highlight of the week loved everything about it the location the costumes the actors and the wonderful music by clannad still have their legend album loved the way they solved the problem of michael praed leaving by creating another robin this time the earl of huntingdon believe there were legends of several robins in medieval times another thing loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors im sure robin and his men would have young after all people didnt live that long in those days other robins always look too old kevin costner with his ridiculous accent looked like robins granddad the only sad thing was the ending its shame they couldnt at least have done one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it happier ending,positive
dont normally write reviews but this film was special couldnt turn it off dont believe ive ever seen worse movie but there sat watching it was like horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway it was disgusting but couldnt turn away where do start the movie seems to think its sports thriller but its so utterly ridiculous it can only be comedy but its not funny not even in dumbsilly way its like watching your cousins try to act out skit on family gettogethers its painful to watch but at least its only for minute or two second string went on for over an hour whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again the writing directing acting and everything was just terrible the problem is cant describe how bad it was you just had to see it and im sure this will never be shown again so unless you saw it youre out of luck mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other bad film ive seen over my lifetime and for every film see in the future that cant stand will think to myself well at least it wasnt bad as the second string,negative
few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this abilityno too many are focused on john lassiters amazing ability to steal other movies plots turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as genius but digressmiyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues usually ecologically themed and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance still miyazaki almost never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies childrenthat said am at loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability where else are you going to have film where three year old my nephew link will sit still throughout the move enthralled year old my niece amber loving it all her own and able to appreciate the star power of frankie jonas and noah cyrus year old my nephew aaron whos review was of course it was good everything miyazakisan does is good year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation er that would be me and year old woman my mother able to connect with the mother characters and im betting the older charas too and loving the cuteness of the child charactersand that is what respect most about miyazakisan he seems to speak to his audience in completely different way than the average filmmaker on the surface ponyo could be seen as simple story about little fishgirl who gets taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there little boy names soske somewhat like the little mermaid but there is an entire different level at play here true to form miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters ponyos mother soskes mother the older ladies in nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willedbut the girl who takes the cake is ponyo herself once she decides that she likes the human world she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams her father is trying to keep her innocent and keep her magical fish but young ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination once human she teams up with her friend soske whom she loves very much although maybe not as much as ham soske is asked to be the man of the house at age five when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by ponyo on her quest to become human frankie jonas yes hes related to the jonas brothers can we just get past that please gives perhaps the best performance in the film as young soske which is good since he has the most lines his character is also strong willed but also very respectful and friendly characteristics youre not likely to find in child character on this side of the pacificin the end ponyos father fujimoto must cope with his daughters decision and his estranges wifes wishes to allow her to be human he hopes that ponyo and soske will remember him fondly and once again miyazaki refuses to allow character to become the stereotypical bad guy although miyazaki has for some reason received some criticism for this it is honestly what makes his movies magical and yet relatable no one in real life is completely bad person all humans are various shades of gray and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters and then theres the animation itself in time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film especially the water miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means but every film in this was handdrawn and for one was extremely grateful for that the character animation was extremely fluid and there even appeared to be some lipsync going on quite unusual for an anime film the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience this is what animation used to look like and what it should look like in the end found ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable certainly not miyazakis best in my opinion that honor is still held by kikis delivery service but still 10star fun movie for the entire family,positive

the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend her aunt edna may olivera person too talented for this film didnt like wheelera sentiment can easily relate to the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from wheeler they left and wheeler invested in revolution in small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king at about the same time woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king so when wheeler arrived it was up to the boys to fight it out but they refused because they are already friendswhich greatly disappointed the people as killing and replacing kings is national pastimei am huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywoodthe silent era through the 1940s have seen and reviewed hundreds if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films have never been able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolseythe only comedy team that might be as bad as the ritz brothers despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey cant help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better for example there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brothers film duck soup yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was silly and highly enjoyable romp at times woolsey talked bit like groucho but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny in fact he just seemed to prattle pointlessly his only funny quality was that he looked goofysurely not enough reason to put him on film additionally wheeler had the comedic appeal of piece of cheesea piece of cheese that sang very poorly missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as whos on first which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing in fact soon after they started their spiel they just ended the routineso prematurely that you are left frustrated knew that whos on first had been around for many years and used by many teams but really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it fair shot and give it their own twistonce again have found yet another subpar film by this duo while must admit that liked few of their films mildly such as silly billies and the rainmakerswhich actually gave 6s to on imdb this one was major endurance test to completesomething that find happens all too often when view the films of wheeler and woolsey where was all the humor,negative
was really hoping that this would be funny show given all the hype and the clever preview clips and talk about hype even heard an interview with the shows creator on the bbc world today show that is broadcast all over the worldunfortunately this show doesnt even come close to delivering all of the jokes are obvious the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame and they are not given any new treatment or twist all of the characters are onedimensional the acting is well mediocre im being nice its the classic cbc recipe one that always failsif youre muslim think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters and if youre white youd probably be offended little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted ignorant or both not that making fun of white people is problem most of the better comedies are rooted in that its only problem when it isnt funny as in this showcanada is bursting with funny people so many that we export them to hollywood on regular basis so how come the producers of this show couldnt find any,negative
first of all mexican werewolf in texas is not werewolf movie this title is bullcrap the story is actually about chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of furlough in texas suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something and guess it actually works because thats the reason why bought this piece of crap it sounded so stupid anyway the movie isnt any good actually its bloody awful but didnt expect anything else when bought it its low budget horror movie with chupacabra monster if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog actors and some gore then you should check into this movie but must warn you this movie is really baaaaaaadthis movie has some of the worst acting have ever seen the actors try to hard and it gets completely ridiculous they almost never say line in normal way they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say its so stupid it almost looks like freakin parody its like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play bimbo shes the worst of them all have never seen an actor as bad as her and ive seen pteradactyl even when her boyfriend dies she cant stop being bimbo about it hate hersome of the shots in this movie were actually quite good the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for low budget project but most of the movie is shot in the night when the chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark the gore scenes are few and short but really grizzly and violent the effects are pretty hilarious really but thats the way like it the chupacabra looks pretty messed up and its easy to see that its guy in suitoverall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and its very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer,negative
this movie is so godawful that it was literally chore to watch wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room but kept thinking foolishly that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right you lose we win yay this movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that jackie mason was funny after that beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape cracks and if youre even considering renting this turd or worse yet have have one thing to ask of you didnt you even look at the cover mean with crap like this you can tell with just glance how bad it is oy vey this movie sucked,negative
the symbolic use of objects form editing the position of characters in the scene these were all used with such joyous abandon by hitchcock that you can really see what fertile genius he had the way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger while these may seem bit obvious by todays standards in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without word being spoken even the title has least four meanings that can see the boxing ring the wedding ring the bracelet the lover buys and the love triangle at the heart of the story,positive
found this movie to be very good in all areas the acting was brilliant from all characters especially msstone and morissey tramells character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute the plot is interesting even though this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels the setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysteriousthriller like masterpiece go see this film now it deserves better than what it got from the audience which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the moviebefore it even startedyou wont regret itif you go see it,positive
rather like paul newman and steve mcqueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of jollies project for robert redford as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the alpine sunshinethe story is as light as powdered snow with redfords smalltown boy david chappellet what kind of lead name is that who with his eyes on the prize of olympic glory gets up the nose of in no particular order his coach father and teammates women are mere sideshow in his insular world as evidenced by fairly distasteful pickup scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of heavens above freethinking independent woman played by camilla sparv the skiing sequences are fine with some good stuntwork involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top tv coverage of skiing events down to the present day plus im not convinced that the winter olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel couldnt really be that excited for him one way or anotherof the actors redford best profile forward doesnt need to do much and indeed doesnt while gene hackman does better with equally meagre material ms sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats redford the way hes doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic wayin truth though theres lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences dont fully compensate and you dont care fig for any of the leading characters one of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it,negative
would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for relaxing funfilled thoughtprovoking movie the absence of sex vulgarities and violence made for most pleasant evening especially enjoyed the buffalo scene but thats probably because live short distance from there even so this film could have been produced in any city its the theme thats so important here im just grateful that manna from heaven dropped down on us try ityoull like it,positive
this is an art film that was either made in or the national film preservation foundation says and imdb says regardless of the exact date the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time periodwith some camerawork and pop art stylings that are pure late 60searly 70sthe film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort this was obviously intended as almost like form of performance art and like most performance art its interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome the film to put it even more bluntly is total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film their family and friends and perhaps few people just too hip and with it to be understood by us mortals,negative
read the book and saw the movie both excellent the movie is diamond among coals during this era liebman and selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw this film should have made them stars shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film it could have easily been franchise release on dvd is must and worthy remake would revive this film look for it in your tv guide and if you see it listed no matter how late watch it you wont be disappointed do yourself another favor read the book same title itll blow you away times have changed dramatically since those days or at least we like to think they have,positive
drifter looking for job is mistaken for hit man in small wyoming town leading to all kinds of complications cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make quick buck and get out of town but finding he cant escape the title town hopper does what he does best playing psycho known as lyle from dallas the real hit man walsh as crooked sheriff and boyle as femme fatale round out the fine cast the script by brothers john and rick dahl contains delicious twists and turns and johns direction creates terrific neo noir atmosphere witty and very entertaining it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up,positive

although promoted as one of the most sincere turkish films with an amateur cast icecream scream is more like caricature of sinceritythe plot opens with the dream of ali traveling icecream salesman in western anatolia town in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big icecream companies he dreams of playing in his products tv commercial with beautiful models in bikinis dancing around him as his dream turns into nightmare he wakes up with big erection next to his gargantuan wife who rejects to make sex with him for years with no apparent reason is it because he is not successful in his job apparently because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global icecream companies but this is what he says we actually dont see him suffer that much he still sells good traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop selling icecream to the people in the town ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real sahlep powdered roots of mountain orchids ali buys motorbike with bank loan to be traveling vendor and gives ads to local tv channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect his wife is not fond of his ways of doing business they always quarrel and ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in moment of frenzyin very successful day his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town in search of his stolen bike ali goes to the police blames the big companies for the theft but of course nobody takes him seriously annoyed by the nagging of his wife ali goes to tavern and becomes drunk one of his friends at his table wannabe socialist of the town gives didactic speech and criticizes globalism and with no real connection jumps to the subject of global freezing ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison his wife wakes up and prevents him an old neighbor takes him to night walk and advises him about life according to him ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing when he returns home suddenly we see that his wife understood his value treating him like hero and praising his manhood meanwhile the thief boys got sick eating too much icecream they confess to the doctor that they stole alis bike ali forgives them and there comes the happy endalthough the plot may look promising in way its the storytelling which makes this film insincere and cheesy first the director doesnt show much of an effort to tell the story visually everything is based on dialogs and the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually visual art even alis troubles are not convincing because we dont see it we just understand it from his words the director markets his film as righteous fight of ali against big icecream companies but there is nothing in the film about big companies we dont see their pressure enough the film actually ridicules ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft and when his motorbike is found it solves every problem ali becomes happy and powerful husband not real criticism of globalismsecond the film is cheesy because of the crude humor maybe the people of that part of turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make film funny may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and clever but they are not clever jokes at all they are just cheesy maybe im wrong maybe american people may like oriental version of american pie style humor but american pie never had any claim to be nominee for the oscars or to have political message if you think that you can laugh by just seeing mans big erection in his shorts and we had to endure this joke twice or an old villager woman saying fk you then you may find this film funny,negative
stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history and deservedly so so am happy to see any of their films ollie is recovering from broken leg in hospital and with nothing else to do stan decides to visit him and take him some boiled eggs and nuts instead of candy chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollies leg cast string and manages to push the doctor billy gilbert out the window clinging on to it getting ollie strung up to the ceiling when the situation calms down stan gets ollies clothes as the doctor wants them both to leave and he also manages to sit on syringe accidentally left by the nurse filled with sleeping drug which comes into effect while he is driving which you can tell is done with car in front of large screen filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad although repetitive and little predictable classic comedy it isnt great but its black and white film worth looking at stan laurel and oliver hardy were number on the comedians comedian okay,negative
ok have to admit that quite enjoyed house of the dead despite its well documented failings this however was the worst film have seen since demons at the door compared to datd the effects are vastly superior however the plot is weak the acting reminiscent of everyones favourite the porn film and the decisions and actions of the characters consistently verge on the moronic feel like trying out uwe bolls latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over hotd2 am not suggesting that he is really the cure more case of different disease but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up ok there it is have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is house of the dead,negative
was unlike most of the reviewers not born in the 80s was born on may 14th despite this my life was very much in the style of the 80s when other kids had playstations was playing zelda on my nes etc now this movie holds special place in my heart already despite me being only years old at the time of writing this review because of my 80s style early childhood watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didnt see and this movie was one of those and one of the greatest tooit starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville simon seville theodore seville and david seville david the chipmunks adoptive father is in rush to get to the airport as he is going on business trip around europe his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack while they are talking alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world even though technically dave is only going to europe so to alvin apparently only america and europe qualify as the world david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller much to the displeasure of the boys soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller later at local café the chipmunks are playing game of around the world in days against the chipettesbrittany jeanette and eleanore after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by crocodile alvin gets in an argument with brittany about who would really win race around the world two diamond smugglers sitting at nearby table klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and needing safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world decide to fool the children into delivering them for them they set up race around the world where each team will have to deposit doll in their own likeness secretely filled with diamonds at drop offs around the world and receive doll in the opposing teams likeness secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds to varify that they were there the winning team would then receive dollar reward they do this because they believe that jamal an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now would never suspect them because they are just kids however this seems to be redundant because on their travels the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally and so begins great adventure this film is classic and see no reason why anyone would not like it it features great animation and topnotch voice acting not to mention the kickass music pardon my french my favorite song is without shred of doubt the girls and boys of rock and roll an amazing rock song that cannot be topped its also my favorite moment in the film other notable songs include getting luckykind of suggestive for kids film eh and my mother as well as wooly bully and off to see the world not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra the scene with my mother still brings tear to my eye in relation to the song getting lucky first didnt think anything of it but when grew older and learned about life it became clear that that song was little bit suggestive that song along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian princes men when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film its one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are 4feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly highpitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child anyway bit after that scene the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband ross bagdasarian jr know the characters better than anyone they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes ross doing the voices for alvin and simon as well as dave and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses nancy cartwright the voice of bart simpson makes an appearance in this movie she plays the part of the arabian prince very small but important role the ending is of course happy one the crooks have been caught the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset alvin complaining about not having gotten his dollar reward for winning the race which annoys dave until he finally yells alvin and the screen fades to blackclassic ending by the way hope you found my review of this movie useful and if you havent seen this flick give it watch its worth the money this nostalgic classic from the 80s gets solid out of headin for the top dont you know we never stop believing now,positive
just when thought would finish whole year without giving single movie bomb rating friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night feared the worst knowing its reputation and it was as godawful as id anticipated this is mexicanmade mess dubbed into english and produced by gordon murray its got terrible sets and effects and features rather frightening santa who doesnt operate at the north pole but instead from cloud in outer space and who doesnt have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is the opening sequence where st nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in variety of languages seems to go on forever and with no story obviously this santa claus doesnt observe the child labor lawseventually we get some nasty and slinky redsuited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to earth just to make little kids naughty and turn santas christmas eve rounds into nightmare watching this movie is trippy and twisted experience and its bound to frighten little children and turn them off santa claus and the holidays forever oddly the name of jesus christ is mentioned often in this christmas film which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on this easily makes my personal list of the worst movie ive ever seen but im sure thats nothing unique,negative
as is often the case when you attempt to take plus page book and cram it into two hour film lot is lost here director john madden shakespeare in love takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off what we get is charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incompletethere is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic the cinematography by john toll cinematographer for braveheart and legends of the fall winning oscars for both is splendid working with madden the choices for locations on the greek island of kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful madden also uses numerous greek actors as the townspeople giving the town an authentic feel the soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the italian soldiers are marvelousmadden does an excellent job of bringing us the italian occupation and the romance which take up the greater part of the film there are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment however by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold there isnt much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated while the battle scenes are well done subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long by the time we reach the post war scenes the treatment is merely skeletal another negative is that the dvd is particularly sparse on featuresnicholas cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight when fight he must cage switches gears seamlessly into man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personaspenelope cruz whom the camera loves gives an uninspired performance as pelagia in part this is because cage so dominates the screen but cruz just seems too placid in part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic she allows the character to be objectified as corellis love interest rather than establishing her as powerful character in her own rightjohn hurt gives fantastic performance as the wise old doctor who knows as much about human nature as medicine however christian bale seems bit overwrought and stiff as pelagias fiancéi rated this film an despite some drawbacks this is touching film that is well worth seeing the photography alone is worth the price of admission,positive

read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but felt that it truly transported me to afghanistan culture know very little about had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint watched this with someone who didnt read the book and he also enjoyed it they had to shorten some things in the movie but it was well acted and well shot film it leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over you feel for the characters and their plights highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience afghani culture there are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch it is heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under restrictive regime,positive
years ago sara young girl witnessed her parents being murdered now as an adult she suffers from various mental ailments did mention she has an imaginary friend this film lulls the viewer not into sense of tension mind you but rather sense of sleepiness deathly boring found it hard to sit through as could feel my eyelids growing heavier and heavier with each endless minute of mindless prattle and supposed mystery is sara going crazy or is it the paranormal better question would be who cares and the answer to that no one no one at all skip this film save yourself some time better suited to do other more worthwhile tasksmy grade,negative

have watched love jones over thirty times it is one of the rare films that depict love story about people who happen to be africanamericans the dialogue was realistically written and delivered with honesty it was so nice to see film where the story line centered on young professional africanamericans this is virtually an untapped market love jones was visually captivating as well the chemistry between lorenz tate and nia long will bring memories of past and present love the feeling of the film is jazz and blues and brings to mine the sensuality of warm creamy hot chocolate with splash of kahlua and butterscotch if you hadnt guessed loved it,positive
the basic genre is thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menageatrois fellowes has tried to make lot more out of this using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audienceits really rather messy though fellowes doesnt seem interested presenting the thriller elements in fashion that will keep us seatedged rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselvesthe dialogue is inconsistent stagey here vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clichélandmine though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score cant create further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces theres also very prosaic dare say it british feel to the filming didnt want to see document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the storyfinally it is in fact the story which lets the rest down just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes woven as vehicle for character examination wilkinson and watson support this metaessay with good performances and john warnabys ebullient colleague simon to wilkinson is welcome foil for much of the browfurrowingim disappointed not that its bad but that it could have been much better,negative

holes is an awesome movie love it lot and its one of my favorite films its one of the few flicks produced by disney that isnt cheesy holes is generally very cool motion picture wish disney would make more pictures like it holes is indeed rare breed of disney flicker shows that is cool dont get the wrong idea dont mean to bad mouth disney but most of its stuff is aimed towards kids and thats okay children deserve to have their entertainment too but disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail but not with holes its the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think its corny really its the kind of movie that even lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate toholes does good job of being mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living little on the edge hope disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this,positive

some people may call cooley high the same sort of thing as american graffiti but wouldnt for starters in ag everyone was white whereas in ch theyre all black moreover this one has motown soundtrack specifically the movie focuses on several workingclass africanamerican students in chicago and their antics the movie deals mainly with home life and relationships in their apartments we see that theres never any dad around but these young men always know how to live life to the fullestone thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible worrying about missing school two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene and the one white guy in the movie but overall the main star is the soundtrack it is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history we even have it on vinyl here at home classic in the real sense of the word,positive

have recently seen this production on dvd it is the first time have seen it since it was originally broadcast in and it was just as good as remembered at first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and suppose it is little dated and very wordy as the bbc serials were back then miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on sunday afternoons back then but that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been am bit of jane eyre purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is faithful to the book as this one have recently reread the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on reading the scene near the end where rochester questions jane about what st john was like noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by dalton and clarke and done perfectly all the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way some even leave out the rivers family and their connection to jane altogether also think this is the only production to include the gypsy scene done correctlythe casting is perfect zelah clarke is like jane is described in the book small plain and dark and disagree that she looked too old timothy dalton may be little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as rochester portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted his expression is fantastically frightening but then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable oh to be loved by man like that there were couple of scenes that were strangely missing however like when jane climbs in to bed with the dying helen and also when rochester takes jane shopping for her wedding things thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricksfinally if you never see another production of jane eyre you simply most see this one it is simply perfection,positive
in time of bad if not plain awful comedies king of queens is more than just breath of fresh air its complete oxygen tank it is in my opinion one of the best comedy shows of all times nothing has been this good since married with children kevin james and jerry stiller are comic geniuses and believe me it takes lot to make me label someone as comic genius these guys truly understand what is funny could watch ten episodes of seinfeld and wouldnt get half the laughs from seeing koq just once other funny people in this show are carrie janet heffernan spence and doug pruzan carries boss im so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem the show has been hilarious winner in time of mostly comic losers check it out if you havent,positive
prey aspect ratio 1371sound format monoa lesbian couple sally faulkner and glory annan living in remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of young man barry stokes who turns out to be flesheating alien the vanguard of massive invasiondespite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing norman warrens followup to satans slave amounts to great deal more than the sum of its meager parts thanks to surprisingly complex script by max cuff apparently his only writing credit faulkner and annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the english countryside rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by derek brownes eyecatching cinematography though annans discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one or both of these doeeyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed which may explain the absence of their respective families some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and left under mysterious circumstances stokes unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray partly because faulkner has pathological hatred of men and partly because annan is attracted to him creating tensions which result in climactic whirlwind of violence theres an extraordinary multilayered sequence in which faulkner attempts to emasculate their clueless visitor by dressing him in womens clothing though stokes alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockeryin the early scenes at least the relationship between faulkner and annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowdpleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude culminating in an explosion of horror when annan allows herself to be ravished by stokes following violent argument with faulkner the closing sequences are quite literally gutwrenching especially annans final scene which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in and never fully restored what remains is still pretty vivid so brace yourselves excellent performances by the three leads bolstered by warrens unobtrusive direction which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations thereby compensating for the films budgetary shortcomings originally released in the us as alien prey,negative

this review also contains spoiler of the first movie so if you havent seen either movie and want to but dont want the spoilers please dont read this reviewwhile this movie is supposed to be about christian and kathryn meeting for the first time the movie is poor copy of the first cruel intentions the actors that they had portray ryan phillippes christian and sarah michelle gellars kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed neither can pull off the smarmy snooty richkid attitude that the original actors did its absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim not so much between christian and kathryn but if you listen closely enough youll recognize it there are also inconsistencies in the plot if this were truly the first meeting of christian and kathryn then why is it that christian fell in love with girl at the end of the movie he supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie with reese witherspoons characteralso the tiein with the photographyyou could be model comment at the end was totally lame and didnt add anything at all overall this movie was waste of time cant believe they made cruel intentions,negative
this movie is ridiculous its attempting to be comedy but the screenplay is horrible the whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that its comedy truly is bad cinematography you really have to sit there and watch it to realize theres few jokes here and there going on but either way theyre all inside jokes amongst themselves this is more like wannabe drama flick that went bad it really is very pointless movietheir expressions reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turns out that way anyway unless you want to be bored out of your ass suggest you stay away from this gag of movie,negative
in dramatising wildes novel john osborne has condensed events eliminated number of characters and generally implied rather than shown dorians essential wickedness if you want more explicit rendering see the film wilde and robert louis stevenson lived in about the same time frame but were certainly vastly different men and writers this story really treats of theme similar to stevensons dr jekyll and mr hyde but note that wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy whereas rls took the scientific route both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil with evil winning in the endthe actors in this bbc movie take different route too from those in the film john gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as george sanders in his role really projecting wilde himself but with subtle difference youll suspect that sanders really believed what he was saying but gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes peter firth too shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion but then we dont get to see as many of his escapades as hurd hatfield had chance to displayits very good production with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel if not all of its ramifications,positive
it starts out like very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other clark movies like kids bully etc but then just as quickly it unravels into directionless mess who is the main character is this serious film or some gregg arakiesquire over the top goofy film is this skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted have no clue found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came cut good minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes yes it illustrates the changing landscape between the haves have nots got it way back in the beginning kids and bully was done in such way that actually felt like was observing the realities of that group of friends wassup felt very staged poorly constructed and ever worse acting teenage caveman which larry didnt write but did direct was terrible but at least it felt like it was suppose to be terrible movie that didnt take itself seriously wassup rockers was just plain bad,negative
this is my first deepa mehta film saw the film on tv in its hindi version with its sita character presented as nita also note that it is radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not nitasita yet what loved about the film was its screenplay by ms mehta not her direction the characters big and small were welldeveloped and seemed quixotic towards the endsomewhat like the end of mazurskys an unmarried woman they are brave women surrounded by cardboard men and one cardboard man ashok seems to come alive in the last shot we see of himcarrying his invalid mother biji he seems to finally take on future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion ms mehta seems to fumble as director however compared to most indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting glimpse of the chinese microminority in the social milieu of india she even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter not her father yet her radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in mustard field compare her to mrinal sen adoor gopalakrishnan muzaffar ali and she is dwarfed by these giantsgiven her competent canadian production team and financial resources mehtas film of two bisexual ladies in an indian middleclass household may be sacrilege to some but merely captures the atrophy of middleclass homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in limited social space kannada malayalam and bengali films have touched parallel themes in india but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoersms das ms azmi mr jafri and mr kharbanda are credible but not outstanding ms azmi is talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors mrinal sens khandar gautam ghoses paar benegals ankur brilliance notably absent in this film ms das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability all in all the films strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema am sure ms mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays,positive
all the way though was thinking to myself oh god why at the very beginning thought right it might be average but the acting and plot on most parts was atrociousevery part in it was so predictable even though the first movie seemed to bare large resemblance to the ring it was half decent movie but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves eg the part were geller falls off the building had me in stitches my girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next and more times than less was rightwhy does going into the house make her come after you it doesnt make sense it was poor excuse for lot of killings and no really depth was seen at allyou can see everything coming which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching oh shes behind her didnt see that one coming yawnssurely these people must have thought to oh dont know carry knife round or at least try and fight back instead of being eaten but someone hair at best during the movie was very mildly scared and mean mildly was just crying out for the credits as they rolled exhaled short oh thank god if you havent already dont waste your time and money on this pointless plot less sorry excuse for sequel,negative

the only reason gave this episode of masters of horror instead of is because the two lead actors are good and it wasnt shot on vhs the story the dialog and the plot are ridiculous talking driving zombies who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war give me break what next zombies who come back to go skydiving maybe zombies who come back to host qvc shows never supported the iraq war but do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces and homecoming was disrespectful in that it mocks the true horror of war with zombies being mass produced in todays market this is the spam of zombierelated entertainment how homecoming made it onto masters of horror is beyond me,negative
like most thought another crocodile movie so far weve had primeval and rogue in the last months what can they do thats new where both those films were about action and violence this ones about fear and tensionthe performances arent oscarworthy when theres nothing going on but in times of distress or terror these people suffer so much its like torture there are holes in the plot and maybe crocs dont really behave like this as others have pointed out but the fear is so effective its stretch to say youll enjoy this movie itll leave you feeling as uncomfortable as the passion of the christ,positive
there are couple of prior comments here which opine about this flicks abundance of clichés throughout and agree completely both with regard to the characters and the dialogid read about elizabeth berklys awful performance in the equallyawful showgirls which ive never seen and her performance here while not awful is barely up to the standards of lifetimes worse fare there was not hint of depth to her character but then there probably shouldnt have been if so it would have placed the film completely outofbalance since there wasnt hint of depth or charisma not trace in any one character performer or portrayalthe principals handling of lizs initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable her husbands initial reaction and advice were likewise forrest gump attacking jennys boyfriend in his car provided more realistic intelligent action and hell he was mentallychallengedthe smarmy unctuous lawyer excuse the redundancy father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time no mean feat her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd also not unknown in the professionfinally and frankly rather enjoyed this part the police were such collection of insensitive oafs that youd rather depend upon barney fife without andy to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community know that most reallike cops fall bit short of the sharpness intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the law and order series and the like but dolts of this level seem to be staple on lifetimefinally found kind of story within story fascination with joshs concoction of his being the victim of his teacher this scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story this was something of an achievement like going from to fminusthis whole lame situation should have been resolved in real life in about minutes following realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities with husband involved but then that would have precluded the contrived drama following and left an hours blank film in the camera but the writers here proved with their ending they could do even worse when the situation was finally resolved and righted this was accomplished in all of about seconds with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any real world context for the perpetrator and his parents or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemptionthis ones presentation the second because it does have some mild fascination,negative
if you havent seen this yet you really should on dvd cant believe how much enjoyed it it is amazingly realistic and believable true much of it is speculated and would have liked to have known more about what was speculative and what were proven facts there arent many of them but it handles everything quite well with cruel mother nature theme it will remind you of the nature programs that youve seen on animal planet and the discovery channel only the animals here are dinosaurs they act natural they eat kill mate play and fight for survival you will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against othersfor the most part the effects are excellent at times they will look little too much like cgis but then you will see them in different angle that makes them look more realistic in some cases you will actually be convinced that youve seen dinosaur my favorites were the coelophysis the raptors the diplodocus the iguanadons the allosaurus and the arctic bipeds was most disappointed with the trex however which looked little too computer generated at timesin any case you should definitely see this production it is educational well made and very entertaining for what it is its an,positive

as most people am tired of the by the numbers clichéd movies that hollywood makes there seems to be no creativity in hollywood companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built inthis movie is welcome change it could be classified as romantic comedy for its genre but dont let that turn you off this movie this is very original movie which is not like most things hollywood producesif you are reading this you already know the basic plot so will not bother going over that the only movies that come to mind to compare this to are interstate and art of travel which are little known gems that take different path than most of the hollywood garbagethis is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the samedean,positive
many of the reviews and comments have read about this movie say that this is rather stale film and performance by clara bow although the storyline was rather typical of claras later silents still find it somewhat heartstirring and incredibly fun clara plays happygolucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she lovesnever mind that this man is married claras lack of modesty was shocking in the day but believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie though definitely not brilliant storyline quite typical actually this movie is nice showcase of claras ability to make the audience laugh,positive

having just seen walt disneys the skeleton dance on the saturday morning blog as linked from youtube used those same sources to watch remake done in technicolor for the columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same manub iwerks the colors compared to the earlier black and white are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gagslike when one of the skeletal band players hits wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another ones off or when one dances with the other with part of that other goneare just as funny as the previous short it does get little repetitious near the end still skeleton frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier silly symphony,positive
the cast of this film contain some of new zealanders better actors many of who have seen in fabulous roles this film however fills me with deep shame just to be from the same country as them the fake american accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong as another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry decorated with few of the multi colour flags stolen from used car lot most of the cast appear to be from the great long running new zealand soap shortland street its as if this movie was dreamt up at shortland street cast christmas party the result of too many gins and possibly bit of salmonella imagine under siege meets the love boat staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the ideaif you are an actor recommend you see this film as study on how to destroy your carer,negative

am amazed with some of the reviews of this film the only place that seems to tell the truth is rottentomatoescom this film is awful the plot is extremely lazy it is not scary either people out there who think that because it stars sarah michelle geller it is somehow like the grudge should forget about it this film is more like dark water except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it was extremely disappointed with this film it didnt scare me nor interest me either lets face it this type of plot has been flogged to death at this stage eg the dead trying to contact the living dragonfly what lies beneath ghost story dark water darkness the changeling etcetc it seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films nowadays are the japanese and the koreans the films that are coming out of hollywood like this are cynical exercises in money making without shred of respect for the viewer theyre just being churned out,negative

rented the dvd in video store as an alternative to reading the report but its pretty much just more terrortainmentwhile the film may present some info from the report in the drama youre taking the word of the producers theres no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film not onethe acting all around is pretty bad pretty much all of the stereotypes of hot shot bitchy foul mouthed government agents each thinking they know more than everyone else there may be some truth to it but it really has bad hollywood stereotype smell to itimdbs user community ratings comments tend to be more right than wrong and have started to glance at the ratings before renting whenever cani wish had on this one,negative
look this is low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problems that go with low budget movies but you must see this just to watch lisa erickson as julie she is smokin hot and great little actress to boot these types of horror movies often unearth rare gem and the power gave us lisa erickson nothing enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with coke and putting in this film my friends bob bill and dennis agree lisa is not only brilliant she is hottie the movie itself often plods along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard but as soon as lisa hits the screen things really start hopping the others are clearly not in her league this is not the exorcist but as said if you want to see fun little movie with hot little actress this is the one to see,positive
it wasnt until looked at the trivia section that found out that the original producerstar of this movie tyrone power died during its making this no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things symptom of which appears in very early scene involving battle that can only be described as pathetic you know when youve been painting wall until youre completely bored well thats the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when theyre swinging their swords in highly unconvincing manner the plot centres on soloman the king of israel having an affair with the queen of sheeba and his people not being happy about it you cant really blame them since theres few things more beautiful in the world than those israeli moteks though the israeli women here all seem to look like cherie blair modern day israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in european and american accents after much talking and dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed and no thats not praise we have climax where the heavily outnumbered israelis have to defend themselves against massed egyptian army who cant read map otherwise they would have known there was canyon in front of them this is what dont get even though their blinded by the sun the egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the israelis never ever realising theyre charging towards gaping ravine isnt this somewhat illogical its also something of revealing error since the horses chariots and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures anyway the film ends with soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising god for his victory but who needs moshe dayan arik sharon or god when youve got an idiotic enemy who cant see ravine in front of him or waves sword like he paints wall,negative
am huge woody allen fan and so when saw that this was playing at the cinema couldnt help myself wanted to see how allen would follow up his magnificent film match point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in gb which is unique among allens work along with what seems to be his new muse scarlett johanson scoop is much lighter than mp and the humor is scoops most enjoyable aspect the plot revolves around johansons character journalism student who gets tip on hot story from beyond the grave she falls in love with suspected serial killer jackman and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding oh and all of this is done with the help of bumbling magician turned detective played by alleni must say that thoroughly enjoyed johansons performance but am bit bias could watch three hour film with johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted she plays ditsy yappy bumbling sweetheart that is kind of variation in sense of allens stereotypical neurosis stricken character she adds appropriate body language for comic effect needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find johansons character sickeningly cute and that is plusallen is allen he is still playing the same character much like chaplin and his little tramp character something that occur in this film makes me wonder if will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however he is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of latejackman is also enjoyable as the suave millionaire murder suspect cannot say that jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the lessin terms of the plot cannot help but feel that this is fresh in fact it stinks of curse of the jade scorpion johanson and allen are more detectivelike than anything however must applaud allen on his ending because it is bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding hollywood version of this film instead of everything being black and white things are painted in shades of gray being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt though the plot seemed old woody still has knack for one liners did find his allusions to his last film interesting come for the humor laugh and be merryneedless to say if you enjoy allens work watch it if not watch something else,positive
rented this film because of my interest in american history and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormons this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his vision into major world religion it first focuses on the troubles the mormons had in their settlement at navuoo illinois it portrays the trial of joseph smith within the course of that trial brigham young stands up to tell of his conversion to mormonism and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith then smith is assassinated and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the mormons to new land despite his grave doubts he perseveres and finally has vision that utah is the place for his colony that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership later as crops are destroyed by crickets he again doubts that he has truly been chosenhowever miracle occurs which cements his place in historyi found the performances to be moving and the story to be convincing and interesting would love to know whether mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal polygamy is part of the story but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised the issue is not emphasizedim sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subjectmatter but it has great cast and will hold your interest throughout,positive
1983s frightmare is an odd little film the director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic 30s40s style horror movies with the shock factor of the thenexploding 80s slasher genre it isnt totally successful mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints and the lessthanprofessional caliber of its cast of young actors but it still has its moments mostly due to the classy performance classier than the movie deserves by the late german actor ferdinand mayne who plays an aging old time horror movie star ala vincent price named conrad ratzoff at the beginning of the movie we meet the hasbeen horror star as hes shooting commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol conrad is bit of hoitytoity prima donna jerkoff just when you think he couldnt be any more unlikable the commercial director berates conrad for blowing take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off balcony to his death nice huh conrad then visits some fans at college campus horror movie club unfortunately he suffers heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die still feisty even at deaths door he manages to do away with despised business associate by smothering him with pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself conrad is then laid to rest in true hollywood style in high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket which will play personal video messages from conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respectsit is at this point that the kids from the college horror movie society decide to pay conrads grave an after hours visit breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party not exactly my idea of fun but hey these are characters in an 80s horror film logic has no place here the college kids spend the evening having dinner with conrads body seated in place of honor posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it before parking conrad and his coffin in the attic planning to return him to his crypt in the morning in the meantime mrs ratzoff distraught over the theft of her husbands body has called in psychic friend to try and reach conrad through seance you can pretty much figure out the rest from here since conrad wasnt very nice guy in life its not much of stretch to assume that he wont be any friendlier in death psychic lady makes contact with conrad and he reawakens in predictably ticked off fashion then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students ridiculously huge house picking off the young grave robbers one by one this is where the movie falls apart endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying hello is anyone there are intercut with occasional bursts of violence we do get pretty gnarly decapitation scene which is the highlight of the movie before the last two survivors finally figure out way later than any semiintelligent people would have figured out the same thingbut again were in an 80s horror film that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get conrads body back to its crypt where it belongs the sluggish pacing is padded out with lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than musicthunder moans and groans howls etc that becomes severely annoying after whilei cant really recommend frightmare to anyone who didnt grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the 80s modern horror fans will doubtlessly find frightmare incredibly slow moving and goofy if you came of age in that magical decade however you may get blast of nostalgia from frightmare fans of jeffrey reanimator combs may also want to check it out as the future dr west appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film studentsi will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the eastwestdvd label paired with roy wards vault of horror and sold at dollar stores because the print quality is terrible im told the film has gotten deluxe release via the fine folks at troma which seems appropriate if youre troma kind of person then frightmare will be right up your alley,negative
people watch movies for variety of different reasons this movie didnt have the big budget theres no special effects no car chases and theres no explosions actually reality doesnt have much of these either at least not in my life this is very real movie about very real people none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology since im neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brainso watch this movie for the characters it is brimfull of whole cast of wonderful quirky folk within the first three minutes kiefer sutherland enacts detective michael haydens life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie excellent acting very believable henry czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his harvey and kiefers mickey enhances the oppositeness of their charactersi thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady mrs ramsay im sure she and my motherinlaw are good friendstheres host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them,positive
think that you can not imagine how these people really work before came to the studios to watch the guys work there actually thought quite the same as you do but since saw and did the work the guys on that tvshow have to do have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long that really is no easy work and also the actors which in your eyes may be terribly bad are really great people and lot of them really can act dont think that the material given to them can really show that as think this material isnt very good but they are truly good so dont think that you before you havent seen these guys doing there work can judge over them and shouldnt have judged over them as well before met them but did and am now terribly ashamed of it so please do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you havent seen them doing there job,negative
as usual am making mad dash to see the movies havent watched yet in anticipation of the oscars was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has there is no story group of guys meander around iraq one day they are here diffusing bomb tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire no wait here they are back in bagdad there is no cohesive story at all the three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures by that mean we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying we have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe and then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesnt follow the rules but has soft spot for the precocious little iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers dvds what do you think is going to happen well do you think the cowboy soldier who doesnt follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways why yes do you think the iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy why yes there is no story here the script is juvenile and predictable the camera is shaken around lot to make it look artsy and for all of you who think this is such great war picture go rent full metal jacket deerhunter or platoon dont waste time or money on this boring movie,negative

most lorne michaels films seem to fail because theyre essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in fiveminute segments tommy boy is character right from snl big fat lovable in their opinion goof who doesnt know anythingdavid spade gets the thankless overwhelmed everyman role hes paired with the annoying overweight slob and they endure miserable misfortunes as they travel cross country to save daddys businessthe plot for starters is really faulty the whole premise daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz can be traced back to just about any movie you want like any snl style film it is reduced to simple motivation empty shallow just reason to see fat guy and thin guy be funny togetherthe movies biggest influence is the comedy classic planes trains automobiles that movie is great because the plot isnt stale and recycled its basic yeah guy traveling home for thanksgiving gets stuck with slob but its real dammit it makes all the difference the characters are real the situations are far more real tommy boy is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters we feel nothing for them and we dont care about whats happening onscreen pta walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relateable tommy boy is simply absurd with jokes like simple deerintheheadlights turning into crash turning into struggle with dead deer that really isnt dead then awakens and wrecks their carthe whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from pta and its eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the steve martinjohn candy moviefarley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable ive never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasnt changed my mind spades given very little to do serving as the movies most thankless characterdan aykroyd is wasted as the evil baddie who plans to destroy daddys business the ending is joke and not in harhar funny way more like oh god are they serious waysome people dig it thats cool but just cant get into it nor do appreciate all the stuff it borrows from not just counting pta without any credit whatsoever,negative
having read during many years about how great this film was how it established ruiz among the french critics specially the snobbish cahiers crowd when finally watched it about year ago found it pretty disappointing but then guess my expectations were skyhigh shot in saturated black and white this deliberately cerebral film made for tv and mercifully only an hour long is told in the form of conversation between an art connoisseur and an offscreen narrator as they ponder through series of paintings which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants and try to find if they hold some clues about hidden political crime the awful kate beckinsale film uncovered has similar argument borgesian is word read lot in reviews about this movie but would say almost any borges story is more interesting than this film,negative
many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare however every so often movie might come along thats honest funny entertaining and memorable the last american virgin is special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients this film follows three friends gary rick and david the big apple misadventures into the world of firsttime sex and true love along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship we follow hopeless romantic gary the main character on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with surprise twist at its ending if you havent been lucky enough to see this movie yet by all means take looksprinkled with many memorable 80s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace lav truly is an original film rarity among films of its genre,positive
loved this show from its first airing and always looked forward to watching each episode every week the plot characters writing special affects were outstanding then the scifi channel screwed up yet again and canceled very entertaining well written show say bring it back know all of the actors would come back would suggest buying the dvds am hope the scifi channels executives get word of these comments and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers only watch one show on that channel now ghost hunters but am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too,positive
didnt know what to except so think it was lot better not having excepted much dont get my wrong its not bad short film tess nanavati is relatively new directer and writer so think she deserves lot of kudos for making this film you can tell that it has been an act of love for her the acting outside of dominic is little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for really low budget film its good there was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on though dont feel it greatly detracts for ones ability to understand the film if you love dominic monaghan as much as do say go for it the gag reel was fun wont spoil it but there is particular scene that makes buying the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over if you like the film then check out the pink mirror film also done by jagged edge know fans of dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven,positive

this movie is awesome on so many levels and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome onjust remember this when youre watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movies be they good or bad this is the formula that they are using this is what makes zombie movies so greatand what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie simple web search will provide you with everything you need to knowall in all it doesnt linger theres never point where you think to yourself cmon get on with it it moves quick and corners nicely this is the sporty little italian number of zombie flicksso awful its wonderful if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek rent it buy it love itas great trivia note if youre watching it on dvd youll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen underneath the musical score well thats because that music was lifted straight from the trailer which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop,positive

when first heard about this movie thought it would be like the duchess2008 but when saw the first minutes of the young victoria knew this wouldnt just be solid movie almost everything in this movie is great the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shotthe only thing that really let me down are the performances emily bluntthe devil wears prada is the star of the film bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is great actress and maybe picking first oscar nomination for her performance rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne although expected more of him jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettableto me the film feels like unfinished maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script dont know but thats how feel about the moviebut overall its great movie about the early years of victoria with great performance from emily blunt,positive
flying saucer manned literally by crew of about male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on colony founded some years ago on forbidden planet what they find is robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth beautiful and totally socially inept young woman and her father hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself inon the surface this story is pulp scifi murder mystery some compare it to shakespeares tempest but this is stretch and in some ways an insult to the scifi genre stripped of what makes it scifi film sure its the tempest but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about underneath this is cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like star trekanne francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful the special effects and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable if it were not for the goofy retroartdeconess of 1950s scifi props you might think you were watching 1960s piecethis is classic of that very special subgenre of sci fi like to call 1950s scifi and though not in my opinion the best it is certainly must see for anybody interested in scifi film and special effects the clever plot now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of star trek lost in space and even farscape is worth paying attention to and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of star treks original series aired about years later though they may find themselves disappointed by the relatively mild 1950s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration while do not mean to nitpick the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem had with it some will probably see this film simply to catch glimpse of young goodlooking leslie nielsen in one of his first starring roles unfortunately nielsens performance is only average and at times downright poor especially at the climax of the film walter pigeon though quite excellent in other films overacts his role as well ms francis earl holliman and the amazing robby the robot are the standout actors in this crowd though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do good job the problems with the featured performances think are as much the fault of the director and the editor as anything though they certainly got most of the film quite right,positive
just saw this film on dvd last night and decided to check out the reviews this morning it seems that robot has polarized the critical viewing community here on imdb and given rise to lot of insults and namecalling tooi find this somewhat surprising as this film is not great or even good but neither is it terrible or even really bad what this film really is isdepressing depressing that the us filmgoer population is so ready to lap up insipid clichéd reheats and acclaim them as spectacular new works this film as retread written all over it from the plot line an uneasy mix of asimov and modernday uberaction to smiths character smartmouthed cynic with backbone of titanium to the special effects that borrowed from matrix and few othersi robot is sadly quite possibly the perfect action movie for todays audience superficial plot insipidly snappy dialog and lots and lots of adrenaline smith is mediocre but we already knew that he seems to be hollywoods latest unsuccessful attempt to create black bruce willis the story has lots of holes in it of all sizes but dont think most people drawn to this film are criticallyminded enough to notice perhaps blockbuster by todays standards but very bmovie compared to true winners,negative

have bought the complete season of surface watched it in days was so captured by the the plot theories and basically everything about this show the actor who plays miles is great miles sister mother and father acted like real life family would you could connect on so many levels its fascinatingi find animals are so wonderful you can almost connect with them as parent is to child it would be something if creature of this sort of nature truly existsam sadden that surface is not having second season or at least four more shows have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in booklove the show very much for those who havent watched surface if you like scifi you need to watch this,positive
this must have been one of the worst movies have ever seeni have to disagree with another commenter who said the special effects were okay found them pretty bad it just wasnt realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual storymaybe that distraction is the reason that did not fully understand the story the archaeologists are looking for the set they do not bother to tell what set or what is so special about it that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egyptif youre shooting movie that takes place in the desert take the effort to actually go to the desert the beginning the ancient ceremony looks like it was shot inside studio instead of desertthe actionlevel was constant throughout the movie no ups and downs no climax it made the movie look short and thats certainly pro for this particular movie,negative
liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early 18th century he is true actor he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary mary is such beautiful woman its her love that makes rob roy the legend but its his passion that makes her love undying they need each other tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect in one way or another upon watching the movie you will find cunningham disgusting the scotland scenery is beautiful the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well if you like history romance passion and love youll enjoy rob roy there is violence and blood but its unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told no gratuitous violence and you do have to listen carefully if youre not used to scottish accent one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes its their skill as actors that attracts you they dont rely on marquee names popularity or sex symbol appeal this is something special,positive
when watch this movie too get excited when seen bed scenes of miss world she has beautiful and charming body when cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body think male have hard to resisti think its time for cute girls like hrishita bhatt also do nude scenes at least no one wants to nude body of ugly women like seema biswas to in bandit queeni concur with what mallickab has said the movie is portrayed in way which appears to be kind of vilification on the original content emotions arent conveyed properly guess couple of notsogood performances also contributed to its mediocrity in my view tabu would have been much better choice for such role instead of aishwarya rai in some of her scenes she looks bit lusty which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed also noticed bit of overacting in some of her scenes im bitter critic of aishwarya rai cant help it sorry for that raincoat was good movie by rituparno ghosh and saw choker bali after seeing raincoat was not at all impressed,positive

having seen carlo lizzanis documentary on luchino visconti was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by adam low but the viewer like me did get dissatisfied faced need for critical opinion which generally dont like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer there are also no documentaries that will examine theme totally but when read the reviews already written on this title also felt bit confused people sometimes dont know what to criticize therefore to be clear ill divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably the former one about visconti before his directors career and latter one about visconti the director the aristocratic background all the hobbies the wealth that young luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented his effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents divorce we also get very accurate idea of where luchino was brought up as real count of milano in riches galore with nannies cooks with access to everything in true aristocracy for instance his fathers splendid villa at grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that there is also an emphasis on viscontis crucial visit in paris in the 1930s where he met eminent people left wingers who later had impact on his style and message in art that clearly explains the idea of communist with the aristocratic upbringing contrast at first sight however the part about his directors career which started with ossessione during wwii and ended with innocente just before the directors death in is poorly executed his movies are not discussed well why because there are very few people who really have something to say franco zeffirelli the director remembers the works on la terra trema and that is all right there are also some interviews with franco rosi but later such movies like il gattopardo la caduta dei rei la morte venezia or ludwig are mostly discussed by helmut berger although liked the actor in the role of ludwig did not like the interviews of his moreover some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such documentary there is no mention of significant works of visconti like conversation piece there are no interviews with eminent cast burt lancaster mention about silvana mangano and romy schneider should also be made there is one footage interview with maria callas that appears to be interesting but that is only short bit franco zeffirelli though appreciate him as director makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious for instance he mentions the event how visconti separated from him after years of service therefore say simplified and unsatisfactory what find strong point here are footage interviews with visconti himself as result we may get his own opinion about his works for instance very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself he also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming ludwigi believe it is better to see luchino visconti by carlo lizzani than this doc although it is shorter and condensed as whole you will get better idea of the director visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned peoples emotions and viewpoints into stone,negative
time is precious this film isnt must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like fargo and this complete waste of timethe theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction is this the film the critics are raving about what piece of crapthe hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family get itthe acting is superbthe production lighting sets editing sound is about steps above minutes story the characters are shallow and unintelligent was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say nexti have had more fun doing the laundry,negative
worst movie ever made ever have no words to say about it other then it truly had no point no plot no anything sheer crap dont know how everyone in the movie didnt shoot them shelves after watching it love vampire flicks and mysteries and alternate abstract outside the box films and this was non of those mean what the crap cant even tell you what the film was about cuz still dont know and just wasted an hour and ahalf of my life watching it bottom line think the maker of this film just wants everyone to do drugs thats the only thing got from this film please dont watch this mean for sultry sensual vampire flick there wasnt even the to be expected nudity youd get from vamp flick anyway back to my point this movie blows go set yourself on fire instead,negative
savage island is lame movie its more like home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting not only that the storyline and script was wretched dont know why this movie was made have seen lot of flicks in my time and the ones really hate are movies that make me angry this one made my blood boil the situations were inane at best if made movie like this it would have been short really because those backwood idjits wouldnt have been in the picturedont be fooled by the cover on the dvd am an avid watcher of bad cinema but this movie is virtually unwatchable dont mind movies being shot on dv but if youre going to do that make the movie enjoyable not some tired retread of superior horror films sans wrong turni have to not recommend this waste of disk if you come across this one in the rental store pass on bymovies that make yours truly angry get an automatic,negative
have to say this is my favorite movie of all time have seen it well over times actually had to buy new copy as result of overwatching it is what the eighties was like and what romantic story with few morals thrown in highly recommend to anyone wanting to relive the high schools days again buy copy now it is classic,positive
saw it at the legacy theater in the joseph smith memorial building in salt lake city this morning im going to assume that ones level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on ones level of acceptance of josephs storyhowever that aside it was very well made well acted and had nice score if you get to salt lake city it is must to see it in the legacy theater have never been in nicer theater as far as picture quality sound quality and ambiance in my entire lifei wonder if the church would let me watch batman begins there being that im lds and regard joseph as prophet was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite few timeswhich presume is expected since they handed out tissues before the movie started anyway im told that this film is available in several lds visitor centers around the globe if you have minutes check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not he tells fascinating story,positive
adenoid hynkel lowly soldier in world war one rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of toumania he creates an aggressive antisemitic war machine and cultivates little toothbrush moustache sound like anyone you knowfrom the safety of hollywood chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort europe to take up arms and defy hitler and mussolini given that the united states in had more than year of neutrality ahead of it and no strong desire to embroil itself in europes civil strife remember it was hitler who declared war on the usa not the other way round it is surprising that chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemicthe story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly humane brave etc etc chaplin is hynkel and he also plays the jewish barber the little hero of the ghetto the tramp in all but name needless to say chaplin writes directs stars composes the music and does the cateringin the full truth was not yet known about the third reich and chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight but even by the standards of the day he gets hitler badly wrong comedian and sentimentalist chaplin tries to ridicule hitler by making hynkel silly and hapless all this does is to humanise him when hynkel the notverywarlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upsidedown aeroplane he becomes endearing rather than despicable as dictator he inspects his subordinates technical innovations which dont work the parachute hat the bulletproof uniform etc and these passages are meant to make us think that the reallife nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside in fact hynkels regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgeryin truth chaplins day had already passed when he made this illconsidered polemic at heart he was still dinosaur of the silent screen check out the humour with gags like staggering up and down the street semiconscious or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings the hero schultz is meant to represent yardstick of european decency against which hynkel can be judged but schultz looks more like character from operetta than nazi is it in any way believable that schultz figure if such had existed would say to the fuehrers face your cause is doomed to failure because its built upon the stupid ruthless persecution of innocent people and how does schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto if he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt why does he persist in wearing his ruritanian uniform chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of auschwitzbirkenau or treblinka but the nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age as usual chaplin thinks in terms of silent comedy setpieces loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line there is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers shaving man to the accompaniment of brahms and the globe ballet watch for the segment filmed in reversepaulette goddard is the unremittingly perfect hannah just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice and the jewish haven in osterlich is ridiculously idyllic so hannah is quite literally too good to be true brave defiant resourceful hardworking and of course beautiful she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage gee aint cute she asks after the barber gives her makeover too cute by far is the answer she doesnt come close to ringing true because chaplin has made her caricature the wouldnt it be wonderful speech which chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author too wordy too emotionally cloyingjack oakie is great as napaloni the fascist dictator of bacteria he brings whiff of muchneeded comic brio to the proceedings but the films underlying weakness remains if napaloni is silly and ineffective how can we fear him and anyway the stuttering stopstart of the backprojected train is fine chaplinesque example of gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worthand where did the jewish barber acquire that immaculate hynkel uniform,negative

this is one of the best horror suspense films that hollywood has made in years or maybe even decadeseven though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts it has everything that good film in this genre should had chill thrills and yes lot of gore house of wax sure delivers in parts it was sort of farfetchedthe acting was not that greatbut my overhaul rating for house of wax is an eight out of tenif you enjoy being at the edge of your seats this is just the right movie for youi have to admitit was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax myself enjoy these museums but after seeing this film will now look at them in whole new different way,positive
never saw the original movie in the seriesi only hope it was much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980s as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified this movie had really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are thing of the past now anyways it looked like it would be pretty good scary movie it was however movie that would make some walt disney movies look dark really this movie was just bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen the only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during very heavy rainstorm other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as kid the story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water not really worth watching would however like to see the original granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80s but he also made very good slasher movie in the 70s the town the dreaded sundown,negative
created in and originally named mortimer before walt disney changed his name because his wife convinced him mickey mouse has become the staple of the disney brand always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature mickey it is in fact his third but it doesnt matter for six minute animated short it is enjoyable the story sees mickey piloting steamboat until captain pete takes him off the bridge stopping to pick up cargo and minnie mouse missing the boat being lifted on she drops her music sheets and goat eats them mickey helps her crank its tail and play the tune and getting some other animals to be percussion until pete comes along again to stop him making mickey peel potatoes mickey mouse was number on the greatest pop culture icons and he was number on the greatest cartoons very good,positive

the imdb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film it should have read be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the 3rd pew from the back of your familys church at years old listening to the preacher drone on about gods will while all you can think of is getting back home to your legoit starts off well intentioned building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as rennys how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast moment it then slowly morphs into christian jamboree sacrificing its plot completely in wash of evangelisticinduced babble believe counted the use of the word pray about times in five minute span near the end after the 31st tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym prey sadly this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last minutes plus it made me laugh whenever character would say prayer preyer to me as it became totally zany indeed even my catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom almost to the point of ending up on the floorfor all the salivating christians who ranked this film stars suggest sticking with your theologyreinforcing safety standards like circle square the ten commandments anything from narnia jesus christ superstar and the like stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as jesus camp the god who wasnt there what would jesus buy or the soontobe released religulousmaybe robert whitlows book is better,negative
tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickfords films at two hours it was quite long for silent film yet continues to hold your interest some years after it was filmed mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like greatest hits performance with bits of mary the innocent mary the little devil mary the little mother mary the spitfire mary the romantic heroine etc characteristics that often were used throughout single film in the past the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting characters illegitimate child for and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question if the academy awards had been around in no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been marys,positive
first saw this movie when was about years old my mom bought it at our local kmart because it was on sale for on vhs she thought that it would be nice christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch this movie however scared the hell out of me you may be asking yourself how could movie about santa clause scare anyone the plot of the movie revolves around satan sending one his minions pitch to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas thats right satan sends demon up from hell to kill santa clause pitch stalks santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on christmas day for if santa doesnt make it back to his home in space he turns to powder dont get me wrong the movie is funny and fairly entertaining however the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell which occurs at the beginning of the movie is just downright creepy,negative
although there are some snippets in this 4part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform these are not very welldeveloped in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugsalthough this program as whole leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely futile exercise and waste of money and for that it deserves some praise almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes tovery real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you if asked they think the drug war is designed to solve for example while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80s at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business but instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame inexplicably alcohol prohibition the violence that ensued and the subsequent reversal of prohibition is totally ignored by this programthis program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war the possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into happy and successful life is not really touched on use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems but not all users do their drugs in excess just like not all alcohol users are alcoholicsif you want point of view from someone who believes that adults have moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science has decided to totally prohibit whose users it has decided to notsometaphorically wage war against just forget about it none of that is in hereon the other hand this is hardly in the category of antidrug propaganda it is mostly an interesting neutrallypresented history of drugs in 20th century united states like marijuana lsd heroin cocaine mdma and oxycontin but there is significant element of various peoples points of view with regard to drug laws and most but not all of that is not very thoughtful or wellinformed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana the criminal justice system along with its often harsh liferuining penalties is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem but unfortunately theres an epidemic in this nation of an asyet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs lack of compassion for fellow humans prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentallyapproved perhaps vested interest in the growth of the prisonpolicing industry and horrid apathy with regard to human dignity its morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have very damn good reason for doing so and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such reason this is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs yet this program ignores itso in sum the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining but when it comes to presenting rational nonradical point of view with regard to drug policy and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives its pretty disappointing,negative
considering this film was released years before was born dont feel too bad for overlooking it for such long time back in january of though attended the second annual quentin tarantino film fest held in austintexas the particular theme of films this night was neglected 70s crime films and boy was her right the gravy trainor the dion brothers as it appeared this print was an absolute gem wonderful performances quirky characters smart plot hilarious comedy and just an all around great time rarely do you see crime film that is so entertaining and fresh margot kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well hope some cable network gets hold of this film and allows many more to see it in the meantime go to an indie video store and hope they have it,positive
the movie was actually romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become famous girl group in their endeavors the oldest sister meets drug dealer and street hustler called satin whom sister goes after because she believes he is the big time who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life though he could be accused of killing her he really kills only her spirit and will to live after which she becomes drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose the story isnt about the street life or the italian mobster who tries to buy stix off then threatens him its about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be discovered back then,positive
first realize that rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst this movie gets that from me because as one reviewer points out its not bad in selfaware overthetop sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value it simply misses its mark on every count contains possible spoilers the dialog is completely disingenuous the continuity is so deliberate its painful daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love and with his final word the flamenco dancers start the mockshock of whats her name see dont even remember her characters name let alone the name of the forgettable actress when her husband the baldwin first tells her that her friend is the bad guy the car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things vegetable carts gone flying cars crashing into each other motorcycles going down the stairs people nearly being hit but remarkably no one is oh thats right except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds and an approaching car apparently didnt notice him there hmmm its becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made there is so much pressure in the film industry to make money youd think that someone in hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing now theres novel idea my suggestion dont see this film dont rent the dvd dont watch it on cable there are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied,negative
picture the scene where bunch of scriptwriters sit around table and one says lets have black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public also black in the street and ask him if he is black then walk away the other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode more laughter now if you think the premise is funny and the show contains many such types of situation you will enjoy this show for the rest use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny another example of the humor in the show girl tries to get out of paying at supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all,negative
the year saw no fewer than filmed productions of wells great novel war of the worlds this is perhaps the least wellknown and very probably the best of them no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place the last year of the 19th century using wells original setting in and near woking englandimdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as spoilers that might apply with some films where the ending might actually be surprise but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world it seems positively silly have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature so lets get right to the chase the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease against which they have no immunity if thats spoiler so be it after book and other films including the classic you ought to know how this endsthis film which follows wells plot in the main is also very cleverly presented in way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19thearly 20th century photography although filmed in widescreen aspect the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity the general coloration of skin and clothes display sepia tint often found in old photographs rather than black colors are often reminiscent of handtinting at other times colors are washed out these variations are typical of early films which didnt use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented good many changes in print quality even going from blackwhite to sepiawhite to bluewhite to reddishwhite and so on as youll see on occasion here the special effects are deliberately retrograde of sort seen even as late as the 1920s and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have more nearly realistic feel some of effects are really awkward such as the destruction of big ben the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hairthis film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells original narrative as has been noted viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story wells description of the martians giant head mounted on numerous tentacles is effectively portrayed when the martian machines appear about an hour into the film they too give good impression of how wells described them both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective primarily of rural england plus few scenes in london involving the narrators brother the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of major landmark big ben but at least doesnt dwell unduly on the devastation of londonthe victory of the martians is hardly surprise despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines the narrator traveling about to seek escape sees much of what wells terms the rout of mankind he encounters curate endowed with the victorian affliction of much too precious and nervous personality they eventually find themselves on the very edge of martian nest where they discover an awful fact the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in very effective scene wells adds that after eating they set up prolonged and cheerful hooting the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder cheers from the gallery british curates are so often utterly insufferablethis film lasts almost hours going through wells story in welcome detail its about time the author got his due in compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact word about the acting dont expect awardwinning performances theyre not bad however the actors are earnest and they grow on you most of them however have had very abbreviated film careers often only in this film the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana in his 2nd film the curate is john kaufman also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing the brother henderson is played with some conviction by bernard bauman in his first film the artilleryman the only other sizable part is played by james lathrop in his first filmthis is overall splendid film portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it despite its slight defects it is far and away better than any of its hypedup competitors if you want to see wells war of the worlds and not some wholly distorted version of it see this film,positive
of the elements that make this the best at this point have to say is christine mcintire shemps scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent imagine that as one poster suggested christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil to be smiling at shemps possibly dyinganother character who helps this stand out is the goon his look was great cross between horrific and comedic goofball hardly character would choose to meet in dark alley or for that matter anywhere would have preferred bit of true whodunit mystery in this but hey when short is this good whos going to complain not,positive

everyone my name may sound weird but there was nothing else any way havent seen anything like this before so it was crazy of course thats good thing it is humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one like chicken little the fish pretending to be king kong and runt the pig saying twas beauty who killed the beast war of the worlds scene and more walt disney company has not lost his touch maybe not for this one also how they made it like they were watching movie and it was like home cinema however some parts dont fit like in the original lion king werent timon and pumbaa with simba when he beat scar in this movie they are not they were fighting the hyenas backstage thers more the reason being why pumbaa isnt so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also its just timon timon timon anybody realise that only timonns story was told whereas pumbaa only had flashbacksbut apart from that its great,positive
finally was there released good modesty blaise movie which not only tells story but actually tells the real story admit that it is bad movie if you expect an action thriller but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations then you will notice that it is story that comes very close to the original made by peter odonnell you have cover story just to tell about how modesty became the magnificent person which she is it is not movie to attract new fans but movie to tell the real tale some things could have been better but when you cannot forget the awful movie from then is this magnificent movie so are you fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with cover story just to make modesty tell her story,positive

decided to watch this movie because id not seen carol lombard before in any movie im sorry it had to be this one because quite frankly this is dog and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn both of whom were great actorsthe problem with the film is simple it tries to put too much too quickly in to story about young lawyer john manson played by stewart who marries jane played by lombard within an hour of meeting her whats that cliché marry in haste repent at leisure in short the story is series of episodes that show the couples worsening financial status their troubles with johns livein mother their struggles to pay the bills johns diminished status at the office the arrival of their baby son john jnr unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother the couples angst about their marriage the babys sickness which worsens thus necessitating an heroic flight by lone pilot in fierce storm to bring special serum to save the child and finally john being accepted as junior partner at the law firmhow many more clichéd situations could the writers include maybe mother dying soon after there wasnt much comedy the drama was lacklustre at best the dialog was painful to hear only the acting of the four main players was adequatethis was the period at the end of the great depression with the usa coming out of its long downturn during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movieso it made sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol home spun american values of family relationships heroism perseverance and initiative all against the backdrop of the average american family who better to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard and it should be noted that the film was released in early so it was planned in soon after the usa began to get production going for the coming world war ii hence this sort of film was great booster for the general public at that time many of who would soon have to join england in war as many here would know hollywood and washington formed an uneasy alliance before during and after the warhowever im glad saw it as piece of disguised sociopolitical propaganda but ill have to see other lombard films to gain better appreciation of her acting rangeas another reviewer noted see this one just to say that youve seen all of stewarts movies otherwise dont bother,negative

hypothetical situations abound onetime director harry ralston gives us the ultimate postapocalyptic glimpse with the world dead left in the streets in the stores and throughout the landscape sans in the middle of forgotten desert one lone survivor attempting to rekindle his sanity takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert all alone he hopes for more but with nobody around he is left with white underwear and passion for local indian tribe until the discovery of camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human coexistence alan man of the book is left on earth after an unknown disaster thinking he is alone he begins living life his way until jeri ryan appears like she would in any dream out of the woods disheveled and unhappy to find the final man alive to be well like alan anyway they try to coexist fail get drunk and before creating the ultimate dystopia they run into redneck raphael played by newcomer dan montgomery jr bonds are torn confusion sets in couple becomes third wheel and the battle between physically inept nerd vs brainless jock even with nobody left on the planet it becomes truth that even the darkest of human nature will ariseusing variable film technique ralston gives us mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled the quiet earth which will be viewing next oddly which he never gives any credit towards with borrowed story guess he does decent job of reinterpreting it his punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while ralston tries to find his stride borrowing yet again from other film directors techniques to attempt to find his own he opens the film interestingly enough but fails to answer any direct answers sure the final days have arrived but could there be concise answer as to how or better yet why these select few survived spookier beginning would have led us stronger into comical film the juxtaposition would have been like shawn of the dead but instead left us feeling like we were watching madefortv program listening to the audio commentary have respect for ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made and his passion nearly sells the film but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasnt as happy with his overall final product there were mistakes ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out while this does make for decent independent filmmaking it sometimes feels cheap and in ralstons case it was the latteri must admit david arnotts portrayal of alan hooked me he played that wimpy school nerd adult role very well he was funny to both watch and listen to and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer he was key player in keeping the film together alas cannot say the same for the rest this was dan montgomerys first film and it was obvious mean really really obvious there were scenes in which thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him perhaps even giving us more realistic performance but alas it wasnt the case then there was jeri ryan she pulled into her character near the end of the film which to me was the culmination of the entire piece of art she goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end confused again she fell into her character by the end giving us just glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured even as the commentary progressed all that she contributed was laugh giggle or ohhh look at that color moment while her beauty may sell tickets one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful this was her first film so can be too harsh overall this film felt like it was missing something though the idea was strong the premise that even with only peppering of people remaining on the earth the evil of human nature still exists jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs maybe because it is consumed by zinc and we as race will always want what we cannot have ralston is not surprising director his techniques are flawed and preused but he does know how to make lowbudget comedy think our idea of funny is different so that is why couldnt find myself laughing at many of the bits he found hysterical his actors provided the level of acting needed for this film which was lower than average his film was loose meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled ie anything with wings survived which overall harmed the intensity of the film this was comedy but it could have been much darker and much much funnier for those thinking that roger avery was huge element to this film as we learn from their commentary all he was there for was money the was in essence the bank for the last man dont get your hopes up for any classic avery momentsdont expect more from ralston and that is how will end itgrade out of,negative
must admit was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of cut last night though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem am true horror fan as true as they come and found cut to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced but one of the great parodycomedy films of latemy only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on lot of the comedic elements the film was not overly clever in its application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could am certain this was intended as humourhoping this was intended as humourand of course there was the gorethe use of the customised garden shears was brilliance besides the expected stabs and slashes in short there was huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths enough to please even the skeptics of this films worththe appearance of both kylie minogue short that her appearance was and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film both performances were fantastic as well as simon bossell the castle in brilliant role as the jokey technicianall in all think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years as well as beautiful satireparody toungueincheek till the very endloved it go see it,positive
am so happy not to live in an american small town because whenever im shown some small town in the states it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless in this movie former doctor whos just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in car crash directs his steps to the nearest small town he must have never in his life seen flick about any small towns which happens to be the purgatory flats and of course as soon as he arrives there all the hell breaks loose he meets blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her but there is tiny handicap she is already married to very smalltime drug dealer who in minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead to know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself ill just tell you that its slightly reminiscent of turn by oliver stone but is way down in all artistic properties,positive
like anyone else who bought this was duped by the pieces of extreme gore and banned in countries or whatever it says in the box have to admit am huge gore fan and am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it tom savini rick baker and greg cannom are some of the best in the business the revolutionized makeup effects in the 80s today you dont need them as everything is done on computer but computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up but digresswatching fantastically gory films like fulcis gates to hell or even savinis crowning achievement friday the 13th the final chapter you can appreciate all that goes into making terrifically gory film you cant tell the difference between reality and magici cant imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film if that is the reason you seek this film then you are wasting your money as many other reviewers in here have noted most of the gore is an aftermath you dont see the torture or the bloodshed as it happens you see whatever it looks like afterwordsthe gore well its here but not as much as one would hope or expect man does get castrated and women does get hanged by her breasts but other then those two scenes and one involving scalping there is nothing really much else to this film the scenes of gore even in these three mentioned are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for maybe its just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre but was expecting bit more call me sick or twisted but isnt that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place honestly found myself bored in lot of placescannibal ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on craze of superior film while cannibal holocaust is not exactly great film it is much better than this tripe if you go out of your way to buy this for you will feel cheated310,negative
always felt that ms merkerson had never gotten role fitting her skills familiar to millions as the lt on law and order she has been seen in number of theatrical releases always in supporting role hbos lackawanna blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as nanny successful entrepreneur in world changing from segregation to integration but the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in boarding house in lackawanna new york suburb of buffalothe story could be set in any major africanamerican community of the 50s and 60s from atlantas sweet auburn to new yorks harlem but the segregationintegration angle is only subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at nannys boarding house the story revolves around nannys relationships with all kinds of people played by some of the best actors in the business purposely did not say black actorsthis ensemble is stunning array of talent who happen to be black except for jimmy smits of course recommend this film as fun and colorful look at bygone day,positive
this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year few too many coincidences and plot holes however we are talking about movie where hitman and white bread salesman become buddies so few vagaries shouldnt come as too much of surprise brosnan is excellent in this role gone is the wooden james bond role he was wasted in if he can maintain this kind of quality hope he continues to make comedies greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnans straight man ive read few negative comments in here about hope davis but thought she was quite good as mousy housewife with dark side buried deep within there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and few scenes where nearly died laughing my father consultant nearly lost it when julian describes himself as facilitator much like grosse pointe blank another hitman comedy the humour can be very dark if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself,positive
as casual listener of the rolling stones thought this might be interesting not so as this film is very of its age in the 1960s to me someone born in the 1980s this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap but am sure this film was not made for me but people who were active during th 60s expected drugs galore with th stones was disappointed it actually showed real life hard work in the studio so much so felt as if was working with them to get to conclusion of this god awful film have not seen any of the directors other films but suspect they follow similar style of directing sort of amatuerish which gave feeling like the tv show eurotrash badly directed tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value my only good opinion of this is that didnt waste money on it it came free with sunday paper,negative
watch the original with the same title from this made for tv movie is just godawful although it does use as far as can tell almost the same dialog it just doesnt work is it the acting the poor directing ok so its made for tv but why watch bad copy when you can get your hands on the superb original especially as youll be spoiled to the plot and wont enjoy the original as much as if youve watched it first there are few things that are different from the original its shorter for once but all are for the worse the actors playing the parts here just dont fit the bill you just dont believe them and who could top edward robinsons performance from the original if you want only watch it after youve seen the original and even then youll be very brave if you watch it through its almost sacrilege,negative
director don siegel really impressed me with this film it is starkly shot graphic without being visually graphic wellacted by all concerned and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in workmanlike almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer didnt know what to expect sitting down to watch this civil war movie or some kind of 70s softcore peddling with eastwood descending on school for girls in the south but really is is neither of those things but rather and examination exploration and descent into the soul of men and women dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized as one reviewer previously noted none none of the characters are likable by the films end and yet each one is interesting complex and enigmatic eastwood plays cpl mcburney union soldier found by young pamelyn ferdinyoull recognize that voice as soon as you hear it girl at school for manners headed by geraldine page amidst the chaos that was the civil war particularly in the south soon page teacher elizabeth hartman lovely young seductress carol and even ferdinamyhave emotionalsexual ties to eastwood each having their own needs and secrets and problems eastwood is not nice man he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage in the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest the beguiled for me is masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front this might beexcept for invasion of the body snatchers siegels best film it certainly is one of eastwoods best real performances page is always so very good and hartman fe5rdin et al excellent the gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic some of the sexuallaced scenes disturbing and what happens to eastwood is leg up on much of the competition for creepy eerie demented film,positive

arguably the finest serial ever madeno argument here thus far about earthman flash gordon professor zarkov and beautiful dale arden traveling in rocket ship to another universe to save the planet along the way in spellbinding spectacular and actionpacked chapters flash and his friends along with new found friends such as prince barin prince thun and the awesome king vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless ming of mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter priness auranow shes car this serial is not just cut above most serials in terms of plot acting and budget it is miles ahead in these areas produced by universal studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from the bride of frankenstein and the opera house from the phantom of the opera just to name few the production values across the board are advanced in my most humble opinion for the costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and firstrate we get hawkmen shark men lion men high priests creatures like dragons octasacks orangapoids and tigronsoh myand many many other fantastic things are all of them believable and firstrate special effects no way but for most are very impressive the musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are wellwritten lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter and expertly scored director frederick stephani does great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating worthy film for alex raymonds phenom comic strip lastly the acting is pretty good in this serial all too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents here most everyone has some ability dont get me wrong this isnt shakespeare troupe by any means but buster crabbe does workmanlike likable job as flash he is ably aided by jean arden priscella lawson and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out but before get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the hayes office see more flesh on flash and on jean rogers and priscella lawson than in movies decades later the shorts crabbeand unfortunately for all of us professor zarkovfrank shannon wears are about as formfitting pair of shorts guys can wear the girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful jean rogers may have limited acting talent but she is blonde bombshell lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful but for me the two actors that make the serial are charles middleton as ming officious sardonic merciless and fun middleton is class act jack tiny lipson plays king vultan boisterous rousing hilarious symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism lipson steals each and every scene he is in the plot meanders here there and everywhere but flash gordon is the penultimate serial space opera and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow excellent,positive
have to say that the events of didnt hit me until saw this documentary it took me year to come to grips with the devastation was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers was sick of hearing about it when this was aired on tv year and day later was bawling my eyes out it was the first time had cried since the attack highly recommend this documentary am watching it now on tv years later and am still crying over the tragedies the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing it was an accident and look where it got them these two brothers make me want to have been there to help,positive
perfect movies are rare even my favorite films tend to have flaws rear window looks little stagey at times chris elliots character in groundhog day doesnt work the music score in best years of our lives is too cheesy the beginning of nights of cabiria is little too slow but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish the script is brilliant the acting is superb all around although reese witherspoon and sam waterston are amazing the whole cast shines the directing and the photography are inspired and the music score is touching without being intrusive like some miramax scores that are too manipulative every sad moment is truly moving every light moment makes me smile this truly is one of the best films have ever seen and wish there were more films like it am glad that reese witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film but am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people real feelings and real problems brilliant mustsee,positive
this has to be one of the worst movies ever made the plot looked intriguing like that of passenger but with the latter movie it somehow worked lot better the plot has been worked out in the worst possible way just few of the awful moments in the movie flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of flying and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the mile per hour winds thereafter the lands the aircraft from few miles out starting at feet thats impossible even for pilots with thousands of hour experience when on the runway perfectly straight of course she is instructed to pull on the flaps huh come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie but then my reply would become the size of the english dictionary this is movie you want to miss take my word for it,negative
regardless of what anyone says its bmovie and the effects are poorly done if youre vampire fanatic suppose it would be ok not out of you others here cant sincerely mean that we are to view this as movie not read it as book so the effects and characters are important as well as the story the story are good but it doesnt carry the film no wonder it has low rating over all write this because chose to see this movie when saw some good reviews here on imdb but got severely disappointed dont get me wrong thought the blade movies was awesome and loved the underworld movies but this characters arent close the make up on the vampires is poorly done and the effects are worse this sucks might not have gotten so disappointed if had not read reviews here that told me how great it was the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something seriously if you think this is awesome you dont care about acting or make up this is better as book out of for an ok story,negative
want very much to believe that the above quote specifically the english subtitle translation which was actually written not spoken in rejection letter publisher sends to the protagonist was meant to be selfreferential in tongueincheek manner but if so director leos carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that have to conclude carax actually takes himself seriously here or else has so much disdain for everyone especially the viewing audience that he cant be bothered letting anyone in on the jokesome auteurs are able to get away with making oblique bizarre films because they do so with élan and unique personal style eg david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky others use subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story eg krzysztof kieslowski and david cronenbergs later less bizarre works in pola carax throws disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it well here it is the pacing is erratic and choppy in particular continuity is often dispensed with superfluous characters abound eg the gypsy mother and child most of the performances are overwrought the lighting is often poor particularly in the oftdiscussed sex scene unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason and the list goes onnot to be completely negative it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions liked the musical score even the cacophonous industrialtechno music being played in the sprawling abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film perhaps reference to andy warhols factory of the 60s much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings and even well into middleage cathering deneuve shows that she still has it her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didnt sink into bathosthere was an earlier time when would regard such films as pola more charitably experimentation is admirable even when the experiment doesnt work but carax tries nothing new here the film is pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films and after several decades of movieviewing and literally thousands of films later simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal poorly crafted tripe at this early moment in the 21st century one is left asking with the exception of jeanpierre jeunet are there any directors in france who know how to make watchable movie anymore rating,negative
its hard to praise this film much the cgi for the dragon was well done but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow also the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tediousi was amazed to see marcus aurelius in the acting credits wondering what an exemperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film like whoopie goldberg it must be an alias and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinkerthe story might been interesting but the acting is flat and direction is tedious if you must watch this film go around to your friends house and get drunk while doing so then itll be enjoyable,negative
remember going to see the movie in the summer of with my parents and being pretty into it at the time of course was seven at the timeright before the jackson movies came out my wife and rented this movie since she had never seen it and was feeling nostalgicralph bakshi ran out of money about midway through the animation process for this movie and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping the animation technique for people on budget this is saying something much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of screen with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of thembecause of budget constraints the movie already compression of the fellowship of the rings and part of the two towers was pared down even more what you get is sort of like filmstrip version of the cliff notes of the booksits not all bad though the animation brings warmth to it that found lacking in the jackson movies its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent fundingthis movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came several years later halfhearted halfhour long tv special was aired which was meant to wrap things up all will say about that is that it was musical,negative
just finished watching 2ftm the trailers intrigued me so much actually went to see it on opening weekend something never do needless to say was very disappointed the story has so much potential and its frustrating to see it get screwed up really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and matthew mcconaughey first off am not mm hater thought he was awesome in both reign of fire and lone star enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off times yes we all get it that he goodlooking guy with nice body but think most people knew this years ago when he came on the scene in time to kill showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like sweaty madman times in the movie is totally unnecessary think one time would have been sufficient it wouldnt surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other no woman wants to see movie about sports gambling unlessenough about that lets get into his role feel his acting was very forced and he didnt seem very comfortable know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner but his lines were corny and cheesy it was almost like he was referencing days and confused lines few times in short didnt like his character even though was supposed to the accent his shirt off corny pick up lines weak sales pitches his character was just too much of tool as brandon or jonathan pacino and assante were great but that no surprise piven is fun to watch as arieoooops mean jerry just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly its insulting that they could take great story and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it box office success cool story that appeals to the male man hunky hollywood actor for female women make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights al pacino with great speech scenes and great one liners every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan jeremy piven to play the same character he did in entourage and old school throw in armand assante to seal the deal plot good writing character development and intelligent casting are unnecessarythis will be good enough for most people but not me anybody who disagrees with me ask your self this would this movie be much better if directed by sodeberg decaprio or ed norton as brandon instead of mmi will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of pacino shedding fake tear while embracing russo the financial success of this movie will ensure one thing the movie going public gets what the movie going public wants big budget crapola,negative

only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts and to be honest didnt know how much would like it switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised driving lessons is modest simple film which draws you in right from the start rupert grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly hes definitely one to look out for in the future dame eve walton is played by the fabulous julie walters loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity the highlight of the film for me was evies rather colourful poem it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs in my opinion watching driving lessons is great way to spend hours the scenery was also striking especially the countryside anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable strongly disagree with,positive

this filmmaker wanted to make movie without having story to tell and did so really awful jumble of unlikelyunexplained coincidences and unidentifiable plot line all without character or clear motivationwe get cliché snapshots instead of characters one in particular is the diminutive and beautiful crime boss who projects an overdone tough guy persona and casts cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guys who have been brought in to work for her nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries tiny suitcase as in the smallest from complete american tourister set in bright sky blue without explanation or apology otherwise its standard visually one other exception is compelling shot of beautiful bridge in ct,negative
they filmed this movie out on long island where grew up my brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer which they told me was colored water tasted disgusting and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again especially in the funnel scenes yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form it never came out in the theaters obviously and it as far as knew was never released on video and im sure wasnt released on dvd yet it looks like it was seen by some people albeit it probably very few so there must be something would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother yet there is no way can find it anywhere does anybody know anything about whenwherehow this movie could be purchased and which format that would be,positive
thats how burt reynolds describes this film which happens to be his best ever he plays tom sharky vice detective whos on the trail of an international mobster vittorio gassman and the man hes financing to be the next governor of georgia earl holliman in the novel by william diehl the story is more complex because the guys running for president this is very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two the filming in downtown atlanta and the peachtree plaza hotel sets the mood just right for the story reynolds doesnt do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films hes very serious here especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets demoted for dope bust that goes wrong at times though the movie plays more like voyeuristic drama than crime film with burt trying to get close to the mobsters woman only towards the end of the film does the violence get cranked up that leads to the bang bang climax just like the great jazz score in dirty harry by lalo schifrin sharkys machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including chet baker julie london flora purim buddy de franco the manhattan transfer doc severinson sarah vaughan and joe williams al capps handles the score with magic this movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever check it outscore out of stars,positive

this early biograph short was so much fun to watch the second on disc one of dw griffiths years of discovery dvd set highly recommended it features three excellent performances by the main leads and interesting to see henry walthall the little colonel birth of nation as campy musician giving countess the eye and other thingsthe countess husband goes berserk at his wifes betrayal and has her walled into little room with her paramour its kind of incredible that they wouldnt hear the wall going up but hey maybe the wine had something to do with it here mr johnson father of silent player raymond hackett gesticulates wildly and this adds to the melodrama but in an unexpectedly comical way the best moment comes at the end as the lady passes out from shock and fear once she realizes shes doomed henry picks up his instrument and fans it over her the way he did it was so unexpected and in strange way kind of sexy and just lost it and laughed my head off the expression on his face from that moment was charmed by henry walthall,positive

first the cgi in this movie was horrible watched it during marathon of bad movies on the scifi channel at the end when the owner of the park gets killed its probably one of the worst examples of cgi have even seen even night of the living dead had better animationthat said the movie had almost no plot why were they on that island in particular well it wasnt stated in the movie and why would the people keep coming into the cats area makes no senseone thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting in what could be called made for tv movie movie the acting was very good parry shen stood out in particularif you have absolutely nothing to do on saturday watch this movie it may be good for some memorable quotes,negative
enjoyed it there you go said it again even bought this movie on dvd and enjoyed it couple of more times call me old fashioned but prefer movies like this to garbage like die hard which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving america van damme moves well for guy of his age47 think delivering kicks that reminds one of kickboxer if you like old school action and and explosions this is the movie to watch this is one of van dammes best worksvan damme and steven seagal movies get released theatrically where live so never miss chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen,positive

although it strays away from the book little you cant help but love the atmospheric music and settingsthe scenes in bath are just how they should be although if you have watched it as many times as have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene but that aside like the scene where they are in the hot baths but did the men and women really bathe together like that you could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on but perhaps this was the style at the time the ballroom scenes were very nice the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful especially liked catherines dress in the first ballroom scenenorthanger abbey looked suitably imposing but enjoyed the bath scenes betterschlesinger gives good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland googie withers gives the best performance as mrs allen feelugh peter firth as mr tilney he just talks load of rubbish and is not clergyman as he should be its hard to think of him being in love with catherine but then the book never really gave that impression eithergeneral tilney is played reasonably well by hardy and stuart also gives sort of good performance as isabella ingrid lacey did not give good performance as elinor tilney as for john thorpe well he gives the impression of seedy and lustful man perhaps not the character portrayed in the book but quite like iti can handle scenes being cut from book adaptation but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me the marchioness hate her she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boysome of the script is peculiar when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she asks suppose you saw the body how did it appear what silly thing to say elinors calm response is stupid tooanyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me,positive

lovely little film about the introduction of motion pictures to china captures the amazement of films first audiences pretty much as its described to have been worldwide and uses actual lumiere films for most of the actualities dont agree with other people about bad acting on the british fellows part thought he was fine but the chinese lead really stole the show in any case found myself with smile on my face through most of the movie people who fear subtitles might note that lot of the film is in english which for some reason is given subtitles as well as the chinese on the dvd,positive
sigh im baffled when see short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot saw this film at festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards it was mildly annoying to see it swiping the grinch who stole christmas heart gag along with the narration the set design seen many times before the whole weak tim burtonish style and the story that goes nowhere and we got the joke about shooting the crows with the the first time alrightbut guess whats really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from comic book circa called lenore the cute little dead girl by roman dirge as any quick internet search will reveal mean what is this this is what they base hollywood contract on and opens doors in canada for filmmaker give your head shake as don cherry might say,negative

the concept of having laurel hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious it guarantees some funny situations and silly antics from especially stan laurel of course as usualthe movie also has subplot with nutty professor who is working on rejuvenation formula it doesnt really sound like logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending its still bit weird but its funny nevertheless so it works for the moviethe supporting cast of the movie is surprising good sam adams is great as the stereotypical butler and lucien littlefield goes deliciously overthetop as the nutty professorthe movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed it all helps to make dirty work to be one of the better laurel hardy shorts810,positive
this movie came as huge disappointment the anime series ended with relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of pretty lame villain but expected shamballa to tie up all the loose ends unfortunately it didnt it added more plot holes than it resolved and confused more than it clarified the animation and voice acting were great but with an idiotic plot dull setting most of the movie doesnt even take place in dull wwii earth rather than the alchemy world and disappointing ending ed is useless for the rest of his days in world with no alchemy and he ditches winry it was altogether pretty lackluster do yourself favor disregard the last half of the anime as well as this movie and read the manga,negative
maybe loved this movie so much in part because ive been feeling down in the dumps and its such lovely little fairytale whatever the reason thought it was pitch perfect great intelligent story beautiful effects excellent acting especially de niro who is awesome this movie made me happier than ive been for whileit is very funny and clever movie the running joke of the kingdoms history of prince savagery and the aftermath the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled thats much of what makes it so good its an elaborate specialeffectsladen movie with more story than most fairytale movies yet there is an incredible attention to small thingsi feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again,positive
was surprised that forgiving the franklins did not generate more buzz at this years sundance film festival there were times that the laughter at the screening saw was so loud that you could barely hear the movie the movie has some excellent acting and story that really makes one examine broader issues you know little issues like religion sex and the truth lots of comedys seem to rely on the same old corny contrived situations many leave you thinking know they ripped this off from some sitcom this film takes off on its own unique direction really think that jay floyd did fantastic job with tight budget on this film,positive
they must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the hollywood bus station they then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived you know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot four young boys playing in grainy slow motion accompanied by voice over narration next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion once theyre grown its easy to spot the writerdirector among the four hes the quiet contemplative longhaired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants this means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from hickville to hollywood only theres no writing or directing talent on display here and if you still cant figure out which one he is heres hint the auteur and his character have the same middle name it took over an hour to figure out that these twentysomething men were supposed to still be in high school what looked like prison was apparently high school the warden turned out to be the principal once more the poor misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement murder and pillage but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father how about hitting back kid like you do everyone else numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose howlingly bad dialogue many scenes badly out of focus cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience overacting in the extreme and if you dont quite get the selfimportant speeches or the slowmotion scenes just listen to the overbearing music it will clue you in and what youre supposed to feel poor marisa ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films the biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies run over puppies chained to tree rob and steal all the while complaining about their sad sorry lives but if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college yeah thats the ticket why is it that every twentysomething filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important so interesting that the world cant wait to see it onscreen if this movie is as autobiographical as it seems then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants,negative
watched this movie so that you dont have to have great respect for kris kristofferson but what was he thinking he did this for scale at least the films title practices truth in advertising since people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film adding to the confusion kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he wasnt sure if genevieve bujolds character really existed this does not bode well for the viewer being able to follow the storythe making of feature was far more interesting than the movie itself it explores the difficulty cobbling together funding for an indie even as the film is being shotto its credit this movie is visually pleasing and doesnt in any way look like movie made with just slightly over 1m too bad the money wasnt spent on better project,negative
just saw this movie on opening night read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it must say was not impressed im so unimpressed that feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some moneyfirst of all the messengers is very predictable and just not much of thriller it might be scary for someone under but it really did nothing for me the climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movies resolutionfurthermore the acting seemed little superficial some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the subpar suspense scenesif youve seen previews for this movie then youve seen most of the best parts and have strong understanding of the plot this movie is not worth seeing in the theaters,negative
went to see this movie actually went to see family portraits which contains cutting moments other short films by douglas buck at the mar del plata festival argentina just couldnt watch it had to cover my eyes after the 1st half of cutting moments and take peek every once in while by the time it was over my stomach was upside down and felt light headed just had to leave the cinema few minutes after the 2nd short begun btw of course was not the only one who left the room it was waaaay too violent and disgusting for me am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it just dont get how you can love that kind of movies the shocking and bloody and horrible images saw got really stuck in my head for like two days also try to analyze the story my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it and just dont think it makes any sense mean that amount of violence and stuff makes no other sense than to try to shock people and thats not good enough reason think theres absolutely nothing in this movie that can say well at least thing about it was good but well guess will never understand that kind of films,negative
wellmade runofthemill movie with tragic ending pluses the way the story moves begins with soorya struggling to live followed by long flashback about why hes there the music disinterested look at the life of policemen minuses the violence and the gore but guess they add to the realistic effects still having peoples heads chopped off and sent in boxes and sacks could have been avoidedno complaints,positive
dont understand the positive comments made about this film it is cheap and nasty on all levels and cannot understand how it ever got madecartoon characters abound sues foulmouthed alcoholic layabout irish father being prime example none of the characters are remotely sympathetic except briefly for sues asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence as desperately unattractive as they both are ive no idea why either rita andor sue would throw themselves at consummate creep like bob but given that they do why should be expected to care what happens to them so many reviews keep carping on about how realistic it is if that is true it is sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on filmi didnt like the film at all,negative
steven what have you done you have hit an all new low it is weird since stevens last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it wasnt even funny steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway as for the action well lets just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege and and exit wounds the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesnt make scenes sometimes flight of fury better be good what shame wasted pounds on this garbage out of ten better luck next time,negative
callgirl witnesses murder and becomes the killers next target director brian de palma is really on pretentious roll here his camera swoops around corners in museum after lingering long time over painting of an ape divvies up into split screen for arty purposes practically gives away his plot with sequence again in split screen where two characters are both watching tv program about transsexuals and stages his first finale during thunderous rainstorm dressed to kill is exhausting primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial much of the acting with the exception of young keith gordon is mediocre and the second finale is ripoff of de palmas own carrienot to mention psycho the explanation of the dirty deeds plays like spoof of hitchcock not an homage stylish in steely cold way the end results are distinctly halfbaked from,negative

one of my favorite shows back in the 70s as recall it went to air on friday or possibly saturdaynight on the nine network here in australia darren mcgavin and simon oakland were great togethereach episode usually reached climax with kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent to their credit the writers made concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possiblei remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient indian chief whichwho came back as massive electrical current which started to kill people in city hospital the final showdown saw kolchack trying to short circuit the power beast amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames oh well you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting ideamcgavin always packed lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his bestdefinitely deserves place in tvs hall of fame to quote tony vincenzo kolchack you are on it or in the case of the hall of famein it,positive
think my summary says it all this mtvish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features gen or is that gen type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations example kennedy has guy invite his parents to his wedding kennedy is the bride done up in full bridal gown and long wig the joke is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying man who claims to no longer have his bits and pieces problem is this schtick goes on way too long obviously to fill out time and kennedy is about as funny as dead cod lying in the sun candid camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one running around constantly asking do look fat recognize the show was not made for me it was made for 12yearold pinheads who think jackass is the height of comedy today so let them laugh thank god the show was shortlived,negative
frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time and just at the moment you realize you shouldnt be laughing youve already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wideopen mouths and glazen eyes you feel piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and well you get the pointbut for all its unpleasantness and punches in the face frownland really is remarkable piece of work that after viewing the inarticulate mess of main character and all his pathetic troubles and mishaps makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time you feel sickenly sorry for himit would have been lot easier for me to simply walk out of ronald bronsteins film but for some insane reason felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer if someone sets you on fire you typically want to put it out stop drop and roll but with this film you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body you endure the painperhaps out of spite or some unknown masochistic curiosity cant even begin to attempt to explainunfortunately mainstream cinema will never let this film come to theater near you but if you get chance to catch it prepare yourself bring doggie bag,positive
saw this movie while surfing through infomercials and latenight 80s sitcoms on tv one night at in the morning must say didnt expect much and didnt get much although rose mcgowan is hot her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast was not oscarworthy to say the least this movie has its ups and downs and does have nice couple of twists at the end but in all honesty it was awful not even typical slasher movie no gore no sex no nudity no real violence just bad acting id give it out of,negative
first saw this film when was about years old on tv in the uk where it was called laupta the flying island absolutely loved it and was heartbroken when it was repeated while later and missed it was enchanted by the story and characters but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music it would have been the original english dubbed version which saw sometimes erroneously referred to as the streamline dub the dub was actually by ghibli themselves and only distributed by streamline which is sadly unavailable except as part of ridiculously expensive laser disc boxsetunfortunately feel that the release has been partly spoiled by disney the voice acting is ok but the dialogue doesnt have the same raw energy that the streamline dub or the original japanese had and think james van der beek sounds too old to play the lead they have made some pointless alterations such as changing the main characters name from pazu to patzu and added some dialogue but worst of all feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to disneys moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking which find annoying in many disney filmsthis film still blows away most recent animated films and cannot recommend it highly enough the plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows flair which is sadly missing from most modern massmarket homogenized animation,positive

our teacher showed us this movie in first grade havent seen it since just watched the trailer though does this look like first grade movie to you dont think so was so horrified by this movie could barely watch it it was mainly the scene with shirley mcclain cutting that little girl in half and then there was the boy with ketchup was freaked out by this film now today being probably would not feel that way just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldnt see this movie even though its pg be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids dont even remember what it was about once was enough,negative
plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted judgmental havoc with one side prolife and the other destroyer of demons seed the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific but instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death despite the title itself being fan of masters of horror since the beginning this ridiculous plot twist with its sordid depictions crashed apart like spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon view this episode as being thrown together from the get go never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to the end,negative
scott menville is not casey kasem that is the first most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt at reimagining scoobydoo and companyshaggys voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the scooby shows theyve also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the originalim not sure what theyre on about yet with the villain angle but it surely isnt following the formula used in any of the previous scooby showsand the animation style is very bizarre and distorted like it but its not real scoobydoo type animation but the weird animation used for other wb shows grew on me this might tooits worth glance at once if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice that right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly besides am trying not to be an inflexible nitpicking fan evolve or die as the saying goes well see how it looks after two more episodes by then ill have formed much more solid opinion,negative
often wonder how movies like this even get made and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch themwith aksar it appears as though the director made up the story as he went along adding twists and turns when he liked no matter how ludicrous they were the script was non existent with inane dialogs such as jo sheena roy pehenti hai wahee fashion hota hai and yeh versace hai madam yeah rightevery one of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped acting was awful constumes lycra for udita and awful suits for stocky emran locales the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble victorian mansion screenplay etc etc just one word rubbishfor those people who love hashmi and his movies watch it as for me ill never get those two and half hours back the only redeeming factor was some of the music which was decent,negative
this movie is an amazing comedy the script is too funny if watch it more than once you will enjoy it more though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes laugh salman khan and aamir khan have given justice to their roles after have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this,positive
even this early in his career capra was quite accomplished with his camerawork and his timing this is thin story and quite predictable at times but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately the first part looks like cinderella story though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that the rich prince will lose his fortunenonetheless because of his good cast and fast pace its easy to get caught up in the clichés then the movie does become more original as the married couple have to find way to make living the ending is very predictable but satisfying also want to compliment the titlewriting very witty and fun,positive
uwe boll slips back in his filmmaking skills once again to offer up scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on remote island an okay cast headed by the excellent udo keir is cast adrift by boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked the mad scientist being investigated by reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness however boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way its as if he couldnt be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life im guessing that boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had it really stinks clearly boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything hes ever learned about film gets flushed the last film he made that was this bad was seed serial killer movie that is one of the worst films ive ever seen this isnt that bad but it is close simply because it should have been better then again udo keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this an almost so bad its good film id take pass unless its late at night and youre catching it on cable,negative
this video is so hilariously funny it makes everything elseby eddie murphy seem very disappointing even beverly hills cop and the nutty professor which just goes to show you how good this really is to be honest dont think that ive everlaughed at something as much as this including naked gun and the rarely seen bargearse this show is amazing although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with that is four letters long plus its extended version beginning with but it didnt bother me see it the funniest thing ive ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too,positive
this film is dreadful it has absolutely zero laughs hebrew hammer adam goldberg sets out to save hannukah from evil santa andy dick perhaps promising enough basis for plot in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise while there are some far and few nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent it is laboured hackneyed and ultimately mindlessly boring this despite the fact that goldberg dick and greer hammers clientlove interest all have quite considerable screen presence despite being played for what might be described as whacky overthetop gags this film is consistently middleclass middleoftheroad muck do not waste minutes of your life on this note the music was good,negative
its amazing that such clicheridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place the characters are so weak and the acting so uninspired that its impossible to care about any of them especially brooke shields the temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible if you like this genre youd be better off renting singles or bodies rest motion,negative
never watched the next action hero show and until reading the other comments here did not know that this movie was the prize from that competition was just flipping channels and came across this and found myself watching dare eagerly all the way to the endyes the plots been done the most dangerous game etc but was hoping for and almost received the gotcha how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end think the hightech was overdone gpss and gave me coldsweat flashbacks of night rider but it nevertheless was not too overdonethe basic problem had with this movie was the degree of sod suspension of disbelief that was required of the viewer do we really think that someone flying in helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at public bridge and no cops show up to investigate could limousine do countless donuts in las vegas intersection and no cops show up pleeease way too much of that type of thing fun to watch but keep it at least plausible thank you very muchthe final solution was good but the ending was disappointing with the after taste of bad star trek episode at least now understand why the acting was so cheesy except for zane who doesnt get near as much work as he deserves imho they were winners from reality showknock me out,positive
am big fan of old horror movies and since am middle aged old to me is movie made before with most being made in the 1920s to 1960s period am not big fan of more modern horror movies with one exception being creepshow which thought was great could reminisce about the stories there but really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with hal holbrook and also the one about the really clean guy was great ending all the stories were great though so why did like them so much the characters had some decent development the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad the horror bits were heightened with close up of face aghast with fear and the funny bits were really funny this sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was complete waste of time and turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on imdbcom lol when george kennedy and an old dorothy lamoure get top billing its telling you something4 of also romeros expertise is hard to find here they must had told him to tone it down to pg standard dont know what this was rated at but it looks pg to me and thats not good thing for movie with nothing else going on its shown on the encore cable channel if your dieing yuck yuck to see it,negative

thought that this movie was incredible absolutely loved it even though my brothers didnt that much the special effects were outstanding and this movie is about my favorite sport golf the only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two times or more in row this movie just absolutely tops everything else have ever seen it was everything would expect out of movie just loved it also it was pretty kidfriendly this movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it anything is possible would give it pure it was better than the legend of baggar vants and the two pirates of the caribbean movies combined absolutely amazing loved it,positive
this is funny film and like it lot cary elwes plays robin hood to tee this is of course the usual good vs evil with robin against the evil sheriff of nottingham the humor is sort of in your face stuff for the most part but still works well comedy for night when you dont want to have to think much its well worth rent,positive
some here have commented that this is the worst elvis movie ever made well they are only partly right for me this is the worst movie ever made period have never seen anything so basely crude and insulting and vile and against human nature as this film true embarrassment to the motion picture industry this isnt even so bad its good there is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of elvis other bad movies like clambake this one is so rotten to sit through its painful pure garbage native americans should sue for their poor clichéd and stereotypical treatment here actually perhaps all human beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as whole stars seriously grade,negative
first of all yes im white so try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race anyway white people hating black people bad but black people hating white people ok because apparently we deserved it where do start wish had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes the infamous scene were ice cube and co get in fight with some really big really strong really really angry and scary looking neonazis and win the neonazi where twice the size and the chase the chase is priceless this is not movie about race tolerance and understanding it doesnt deliver this is racist movie that reaffirm all the cliché stereotypes the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in skinheadcmon simply awful do regret ever seeing itsave your time and the dreadful experience of poorly written poorly acted dull and clearly biased picture if you are into the subject go and rent american history now thats movie,negative
donald pleasance and peter cushing united in one horror film that always sounds like terrific plan two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like the flesh and the fiends and from beyond the grave pairing up in mid70s satanic themed exploitation flick how can this possibly go wrong well unfortunately it can to my deepest regret land of the minotaur can hardly even be called mediocre and that in spite of the cast the exotic setting the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise in remote little area in greece more particularly near an archaeological site multiple tourists vanish because baron peter cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to firebreathing minotaur statue cushing who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before owns giant medieval castle and apparently in greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns that is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists when three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area father roch the priest of couple of towns before decides to investigate land of the minotaur is boring and extremely slowpaced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate satanic atmosphere and doesnt bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details the titular minotaur for example is an intriguing creature of greek mythology with the head of bull and the body of person but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance instead the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises the only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of film chance is because of donald pleasance his portrayal of rude bossy and oldfashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always,negative
the three shorts included on this compilation issued in are timeless chaplin classics nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either chaplins score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between the shorts are also well done the problem with this compilation is minor one yet annoying the shorts have been stretchprinted to fit the frame ps speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at frames ps this results is jerky motion that doesnt look very attractive and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time its just not excusable that the current dvd version is unrestored the films look dirty as they did in and are still stretch printed there are separate restored versions of these classics available even on dvd and it would not be problem to restore the image but alas this has not been donea minor quibble has taken up lot of space in my article but say again minor quibble it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating the shorts are still worth,positive

years ago saw the godfather and it made lasting impression on me the atmosphere of the movie was first class the acting memorable and the storyline classic recently bought the trilogy and after watching part again looked eagerly to viewing part was so pleased to realize early on into part that here was fitting follow on to the great godfather movie again everything was just about perfect and could not wait to see godfather iii wrong wish id stopped at ii the storyline was not good it seemed to me like story made up just to have story the characters were weak especially the daughter pacinos protege was weak character that would have been eaten alive in godfather or then scenes such as corleone being invested with all the trappings of the catholic church with full choir the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting where the goodies get away and everyone else is shotdaughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across board the pathetic shooting on the steps corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes man of his intelligence and guile isnt ready for an emergency no it was not good and with the best will in the world wont be able to watch it again but ill watch many times down the years,negative

now have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly im appalled for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then im afraid dont know what the world has come to let me tell something started watching many tv shows like lost prison break dexter deadwood and even invasion but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season especially lost and prison break which refuse to watch because the companies took genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season then we have the sopranos can honestly say that this is the only television series that have ever watched where have been enthralled in all of its season and more importantly all of its episodes there is no department that this show doesnt excel in acting nothing short of superb james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode after heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony felt that it wouldve been the better choice however after watching the first few episodes knew that hbo had done great job in casting james as tony the raw emotion he displays is superb then we have everyone else edie falco michael imperioli lorraine bracco dominic chianese whom remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie walnuts gualtieri and silvio dante all of these actors perform to the best quality and all giving an excellent performance in each episode then we have the story never have been so sucked into tv show before the story is nothing short of excellent each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic feel that the sopranos is one show that can watch again and again and never get bored of its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television and challenge anyone to find real flaw in the show not just say its too violent or they feel that the character of tony is immoral mean it is mafia show at the end of the day dont think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god implore everyone to watch this show because believe me youll be hooked from the very first episode was and have even gotten few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show hooked on it trust me when say that this show is godsend compared to the crap that comes on tv after youve watched the first season youll inevitably agree with me when once again say that this show dominates television and no tv show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos,positive
id give this negative rating if could went into this movie not expecting much but had an open mind the whole thing is stupid the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are boob and guys johnson oh how original if were year old boy might laugh at that have no idea how this movie became so popular seriouslythe worst thing ive ever seen wasnt entertained it wasnt funnyi wasnt even bored wasnt anything it wasnt even so bad it was good its just bad ridiculous actually please do not waste your money on this movie dont even rent this movie no clue how its getting such high rating,negative
most people are totally unaware that this movie exists fox which paid judge to make it has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer well am here to tell you that this is funny and rather frightening look at future that is not that hard to believe basically judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by wide margin then these stupid are getting more stupid by basically spending all of their time watching tv and having sex which produces more stupid people by person of average intelligence today will appear to be genius that talks all faggy seriously is this really that hard to believe oh sure this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid but still plausible luke wilson is great as the time traveling army guy hopelessly trying to get back to more comfortable time where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny oneliners like can we family style her and hey man im bating here this is funny movie and rather sharp social commentary on an american society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure comfort and stupidity and guarantee you that will be buying this on dvd the first day it comes out and watching it over and over,positive
this is great ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late 80s obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was can remember being freaked out by metal teens when was kid it doesnt help that found desecrated grave in my hometowns graveyard when was ten turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile but love it now as year oldi bought this dvd used for bucks and expected it to suck due to the lame cover but to my surprise it ruled it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal and you gotta love scene where guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd this movie is awesome if you love 80s metal and bad movies this ones for you,positive
while not quite as good as murder is announced which was not only delightful but almost surpassed the book this is an excellent adaptation and you know what it is huge improvement on the geraldine mcewan version now dont take pride in bad mouthing the geraldine mcewan adaptations two or three of them were surprisingly good but others started off well but ruined by either poor script confusing final solution or both the geraldine mcewan version suffered from plodding pace and both of the above problems and would consider second worst of the itv adaptations worst being sittaford mystery which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing this adaptation of the book nemesis is huge improvement it not only respects the book despite few liberties but it pretty much rectifies the problems the itv version had despite the added character of lionel coming across as rather irritating more to do with how he was written than how he was acted and one or two moments of sluggish pacing this is solid as an adaptation of decent book it is beautifully filmed with nice photography and period detail and the music as always is excellent the performances are wonderful this time around and make the most of an in general welldone script with joan hickson brilliant as always as miss marple and solid turns from liz fraser helen cherry joanna hole and anna cropper margaret tyzack is outstanding though in chilling and moving performance as clothilde overall well worth watching better than the recent version in pretty much all departments bethany cox,positive

had heard and read so many good things about weeds that was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable series like entourage sopranos or mad men but that slowly eroded away with each episode watched from season one didnt make it past the first six episodes the writing was unoriginal contrived and the portrayal of blacks embarrassing the dialog felt forced like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip it was rare moment when actually emitted an audible laughthe characters never developed enough for me to care about them they were selfish and unappealing absolutely hated the addition of the brotherinlaw who should have been hauled away on to catch predator and the removal of the hodes daughter quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in mexico was so unoriginal and cliché had to conclude the writers were testing the viewers loyaltyepisode after episode liked the characters less and couldnt get past many of the technical flaws in the story lineadd to that heard that season two wasnt as good so lost all motivation to continue to watch this play outif youre fan of good casting and writing suspect this show will be challenge for you to like unless of course youre stoned and then all bets are off,negative
this movie is among my favorite foreign films some of the others are amilee and my life as dog the similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films is that it takes mundane slice of life and transforms it into profound heartfelt lesson in japan man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life sees beautiful japanese woman staring out the window of dance studio in the instant that it takes his train to pass he is enthralled by her but is it only by her beauty by her faraway glance or connection that they will both discover that they share shall we dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of japanese society they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away it is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and in itself transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be,positive
as if the film were not of value in itself this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as preface to reading it in the summer of saw the film in nyc that fall in graduate school read the book for the first time some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film and for better or worseand ive now read and taught the novel for over three decadesmilo oshea is still leopold bloom,positive
this film is lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in rural cuban town the year of the castro revolution it is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love the names cuba libre and cuban blood are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film dreaming of julia makes much more sense it has more in common with european cinema than with rambo and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to peoples daily lives and pursuits that fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in cuban historythe excessive use of the voiceover narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator couldthe comparisons to cinema paradiso and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies but there is an underlying pain at the loss of lifestyle that surpasses lost love the revolution like the film julie never seems to have an ending,positive

very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and handful of nice gruesome makeup effects daniella is beautiful twentysomething girl carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing shes the reincarnation of female ancestor who was said to be werewolf she kills her brotherinlaw during nightly encounter and gets submitted in hospital she escapes again however and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives doctors and relatives its all pretty to look at and listen too really great soundtrack but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast luckily enough leading lady annik borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around fire the film is too long too weird and too forgettable the biggest surprise comes at the end when suddenly and out of the blue director rino di silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts yeah right,negative
this is an interesting hard to find movie from the early 70s starring jan michael vincent as young man who doesnt make the cut as marine dressed in baby blue outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home the failed recruits are sent packing vincent stops at bar and runs into very young richard gere who has just returned from tour in the pacific as hardcore marine raider geres character is already jaded and contemplating desertion and he takes advantage of vincents innocence stealing his baby blue uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway vincents character whose name is marion takes geres outfit and is suddenly transformed into marine raider marion hitchhikes his way into wyoming and stops at little norman rockwelllike little town in the local café he meets rose hudkins who immediately catches his eye staying with hudkins parents marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks mr hudkins suspects marion and wonders how marine raider could still be so innocent the story also brings up the japanese internment camps as the towns folks go hunting escapees marion is shot accidentally during this hunt but theres still happy ending which befuddled me bit would have preferred little more drama anyway this captures jmv at the peak of his 70s performances buster and billie baby blue marine and white line fever in the mid70s were amazingly good jmv performances he was both an action star and heartthrob all at the same time he made lot of quality movies during his career and continued to do so up into the mid 80s with the great tv show airwolf he does very good job in this as hedge quietly observing the way people treat him in his uniform as he travels across the country he must have performed some of the stunt work as well there is harrowing river scene at the end of the movieand it looks like hes the guy getting tossed down the river to me but really at the height of his popularity this movie could have done so much more with jmvs talent and his looks innocence can only be so interesting evil as explored in buster and billie is much more dramatic anyway glynnis oconnor is delightful as rose the whole look of the movie is like norman rockwell painting the outdoor scenes are gorgeous must have been filmed in canada,positive

jäniksen vuosi is one of jarvas most political movies it takes stance strongly against modern day societys authority status in the life of the common man and how it has estranged men from the nature completely it challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare societyvatanen antti litja smothered buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations tries to rattle the chains of the society by escaping it all in to the wilderness of northern finland only to realize that the concept of free country isnt all that unambiguous in other words the society has the common man by the ballsstill the thing that makes jäniksen vuosi so exceptional besides the visual and humouristic brilliance is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in finland in the 70s as well as the whole identity of finland as nation vatanen is like an archetype of classical finn in his solitudeness and social distantness since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us finns the whole idea of that being slowly taken away by the modern society makes jäniksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally moving,positive

after seeing dick tracy in the bin at future shop decided to give it go with no previous knowledge and being big fan of mafia and crime movies was very surprised to see very fun smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout the movie moves along well it has of course another solid performance from warren beatty but the real standouts of the film are al pacino and madonna was happy to find out that pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city madonna was great as the damsel in distress she really impressed me and added depth to her performance if you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch fun smart movie with great acting and solid script then give dick tracy try dont think you will be disappointed and watch for the cameos from paul sorvino james caan kathy bates and dustin hoffman among others,positive
send them to the freezer this is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh an incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than horror film the complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile if you can stand it definitely dark film but also bit redemptive,positive

dont know why some people criticise that show so muchit is great funny show probably not the right material for mainstream primetime but stillthe family dynamics are funny and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried roy jibes are only just above average but ever so often you have subplots or oneliners that make you roll on the floor laughingthis show was well worth the pounds paid for itrating,positive
mexican werewolf in texas is set in the small border town of furlough where anna erika fay lives her best friend is rosie martine hughes she has mexican boyfriend named miguel gabriel gutierrez who are determined to track beast down that has been terrorising the town killing livestock several residents including some of their friends local mexican legends speak of the chupacabra an evil creature from myth legend erm im struggling now because not that much else actually happenswritten directed by scott maginnis wont beat about the bush here simply say that mexican werewolf in texas is awful period the script only ever mentions the word werewolf once the rest of the time its referred to chupacabra in fact suspect this wasnt really conceived as werewolf flick at all the werewolf creature looks mostly hairless more like some vicious dog there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon it actually attacks during the day on couple of occasions there is no transformation scene at the end when it is killed it doesnt change back into anyone either to be honest apart from the title theres nothing here to indicate werewolf film at all even then the title is just ripoff of the highly popular an american werewolf in london this is the type of home made crap that personally think is killing the horror genre how long has it been since there was true low budget horror classic like dawn of the dead the evil dead halloween or friday the 13th which were all made on shoe string budgets maybe the blair witch project but thats it in recent years crap like mexican werewolf in texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered classic the characters are awful things just happen around them the dialogue is rubbish the pacing is terrible the story sucks virtually sent me to sleep as whole this film is just crap im sorry but dont know how else to describe itdirector maginnis does nothing to make this watchable theres the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone headache quick blink youll miss something editing which just annoys irritates in equal measure its not scary theres no nudity theres no tension or atmosphere the special effects are awful the monster really does look poor its no wonder maginnis keeps it in the shadows or cuts his scenes so quickly you never get good look at it theres virtually no colour to the picture either its either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand oranges which makes the thing an eye sore as well the gore consists of some fake guts blink youll miss them few bloody wounds severed arm big dealwith supposed budget of about admit the budget was low but simply refuse to accept that for making such rubbish film there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their meagre budgets go far the whole thing has the look of home movie it has no style is throughly bland dull to look at the acting sucks too although you probably already knew thatmexican werewolf in texas will probably con few people into rentingbuyingwatching it because they might mistakenly think its sequel to john landis classic which it most certainly isnt it isnt even proper werewolf flick either dont be fooled this is awful im fed up of having to waste timemoney on home made amateur crap like this,negative
found this to be surprisingly lighthanded touch at 1950s cultureclash movie john wayne would hardly be ones first choice as cultural attache being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as bullrun in harrods but this time he was left to play part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona and he accomplished his task with style the duke was guy who really could act well his facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtledespite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time he failed to dominate this movie many of his good intentions came cropper he had authority over nobody and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarianthe story of american attempts to curry favour with an isolationist japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hellforleather battles cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well there was great deal of minutelychoreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props the set pieces were complex and detailed lot of money and thought had been applied to itthe fractured romance between wayne and his geisha added little extra element and stopped the movie becoming just political or flagwaving effort script was good without being too wordy there was great deal of japanese dialogue but the lengthy periods of translation didnt interfere with the narrative it was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set whether or not they were japanese couldnt say but anyway they looked the part at least the leads were not played by crossdressing caucasians unlike other efforts such as blood alley yes know they were chinese the inn of the sixth happiness or even the king and ifrankly enjoyed this more than any of those other movies the script was better for start never liked the songs in the king and and wasnt impressed by the heavyladen anticommunist subtext of blood alley confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of the dukes more popular outingsrecommended,positive
was so glad came across this short film im always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across so when saw this and saw that it was nominated for the live action short film at the academy awards was so pleased that actually had film that was rooting forthe plot is pretty simple the director writer and star nacho vigalondo tried coming up with reason people would suddenly break out into song and dance number like they do in movie musicals the result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchyits well made short film well edited and the actors all do great job and the last shot of the film is perfecti highly recommend this film,positive
thought before starting with these movie that it might be good one but when started with it found it really awful they said movie is being made in afghanistan but think of the movie is shot in india you can see indian made cars you can see lars drinking bislerian indian water brand hindi written on the road you can also see temples in afghanistan hahah its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in afghanistan think one should not waste hisher time watching this movie pure time waste would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but dont watch this waste of time,negative
truly appalling waste of space me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about minutes from the end and can count the films have switched off before the end on one handthe script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring wouldnt be surprised if they found the script in pile of cast off scripts from for example the irritating scroat threatening the real estate guy from his house phone mean seriously the police would be beating his door down in minutes the scenes and events just wash by you like turds in river it is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film the narrative flicks between characters in seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters oh and what characters they are the protagonist played by rourke is dreadful he could have just sent cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed after or so minutes of the film had built absolutely zero attachment to this character he is neither sympathetic nor hateful just disfigured dummy from shop window blundering through every single scene his motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery is he happy is he sad angry no idea just those same dead eyes staring out at you from disfigured chunk of flesh and the native american theme is just awful and pointlessthe good guys are at best unlikeable dull white collar stereotype and simpering neurotic exwife stereotype cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy you arent going to shoot me that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoyingthe richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivatedroasario dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from jackie brown you really want me to believe her character was so attracted to rourkes or worse she is just floozy who sleeps with anything that moves realistic female characters ftw in summary complete mess of film hopeless characterisations and performances leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction and ultimately extremely dull its not even comedy bad either laughing at rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first turgid minutes of the film,negative

one could wish that an idea as good as the invisible man would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects but this is not the case the story the characters and finally the entire last minutes of the film are about as fresh as madscientist flick from the early 50s there are some great moments mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets but alas soon were back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but schematicthere has been great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past years and some of them have their charms but its becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven who does have his moments is very bad one it is obvious that the money is the key issue here the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as result hollow man is seriously undermined with clichés sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoeverhowever the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing when making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex is very toned down when the whole world blows up the good guys go oh darn and oh my god hollow man gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them im not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears think we can thank verhoeven for that,negative

all ever heard while being raised was equality of the sexes and here we have film that not only exemplifies imbalance but continues through with whole concept that one sex is better all the while watching was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future and there wasnt ill admit to not finishing the film had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man adam that it was ok to be whore and get and quote more tail than any man in the past time know not finishing it is bad review on myself but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to develope story that will keep viewer interested and they failed this film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance instead it exemplifies what america ran by lesbian natzis would be likeand im not against lesbians thank you mr director someone please give me redeeming quality wait have it theres no sequel,negative
do regret that have bought this series expected more action more objective picture and more consistency this is just pure propaganda series very dark without any charm or romanticism it is just boredom itself find the actors work quite weak as well odonnell might seem charming as robin with batman but in this picture he lacks any charm probably while he becomes older he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of grown up it comes as no surprise that it was not shown in lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands,negative

this film was very well advertised am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months while was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it then went and saw it was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until remembered that had paid for this movie made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood was in plus wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie always go into movie with an open mind not trying to go into them with too many expectations but this movie was not that funny now it wasnt the worst movie ive ever seen but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it but for true comedy fans id say pass maybe even check out the kings of comedy again something told me to go see meet the parents instead,negative
as far as know this was my first experience with icelandic movies its such relief to see something else than your regular hollywood motion picture too bad that movies like this one have small chance of succeeding in the big world can only hope that people watch this by accident by recommendation or otherbecause its really worth while left the cinema feeling really sad couldnt get the tragic destinys of the characters out of my head and it impressed me even more when thought of the complexity of the film not only was it tragic story it had excellent comic reliefs and very good soundtrackif you have the opportunity watch it its really thought provoking and made me ponder lot,positive
very typical almodóvar of the time and in its own way no less funny than many of his later works and why is that there is nothing to be provoked or shocked about and guess any such effect is more coincidental than intentional no the great humor stems from an underlying almost surreal absurdity that is woven into the scenery the characters nearly complete lack of taboo its the same kind of comic suspense you find in his later works though youll find it in more rough version here hes building up for masterpieces to come but is not yet therethe sole reviewer who commented on this movie before did claimed that it had to be very select group of people whod find this movie hilarious do,positive
once again doctor who delivers the goods by the bucket load it has humour youre just making it up as you go along yup but do it brilliantly action monsters in this case still more kickass cybermen tragedy and scare tactics in short just what the doctor ordered pun intended the way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of get on with it so chalk up out of the last episodes that have made you laugh then made you cry and made you go eekin terms of character development this is clearly the clincher for noel clarkes mickey and ricky being one of the doctors companions you know that he will do the right thing and may even suspect the manner that he does it however it is still an emotional wrench when he confirms his future pathwhile the rise of the cybermen had more of the sinister build up to terror the age of steel is an all out blast like alien compared to aliens both true classics but in different ways can the series keep it up at this level lets hope so,positive

took my year old to see this movie we left after or minutes it was absolutely awful this movie should be rated at the least am not that strict with movies but this was just too much it was waste of money thought it would contain some comedy and knew the comedy would probably be crude but this was way beyond crude was sitting there watching and reading certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me and could not believe how crudely sexual it was could not believe that it would be ok for year old to read and see this content dont understand how the rating system works,negative

its not easy to find judas kiss on vhs its not available on dvd but wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my alan rickman movie collectioni cant understand how the talented mr rickman gets into these mediocre films judas kiss boasts several wonderful actors an interesting plot and intriguing twists but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been great crime drama many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the characters actions why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses why did he mistrust the detective he replaced there were times when honestly couldnt tell if the director meant judas kiss to be legitimate crime drama or campy spoof why else would he toss in toplessalienlesbian porno scene in the first two minutes that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby did he purposely instruct his two distinguished english actors alan rickman and emma thompson to use such awful new orleans accents as an alan freak confess that still thought mr rickman was sexy in rumpled weary takehimhomeandtuckhimin sort of wayjudas kiss isnt great movie but it does have some intriguing moments but dont recommend it unless youre trying to immerse yourself in alan rickman,negative
first of all should point out that really enjoyed watching this documentary not only it had great music in it but the shots and the editing were also wonderful however all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the orientalist east meets west cliché that bothers many turks like myself okay this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary turkish music in very stylish manner which is good thing something that would show ignorant europeans and americans that this country is not just about murdering armenians and kurds however the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as east from the eyes of the west mean like one jazz musician says in the film maybe there is no east and west maybe it is just myth lie created by the ruling leaders of western countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and keep the cash flowing why dont you think about that,positive
stmd is not terrible movie but it is quite forgettable the lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest so you are likely to come out of viewing with headache or eyestrain special effects are imaginative but obvious the gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there of course along with the archetypical teenagers but the whole movie just doesnt gel what was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongueincheek humori cant really recommend that you use your time watching this movie often give nod to movie based on just scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor but these are sadly lacking in this film,negative
first off have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen its not even the low budget scifi channel movie its just awful me and my friend who love action movies independence day jurassic park lotr etc went to see this movie expecting this movie to me transformers with dragons mindless entertainment all we got was mindless hour and half the cg was not as bad as was expecting but the plot is so awful along with the acting it made up for it its basically chinese legged of dragons returning every yearssounds like good remake of rain of fire no the plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes but with magic and very small actual war between dragonsrather big snakes it just gets ridiculous the director attempted to add bit of humor in the movie which fail me and my friend laughed through the whole thingalong with all of the audience and cant believed we spent money on this the short trailer on tv makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest ive seen lot of movies like reptilian the cave spider and others but have to say if you want non stop laugh for an hour watch thisstory cg acting310i dont drinkbut it would have helped before watching this movie,negative
am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie but can tell you that was thoroughly entertained by this movie the character of gustplayed perfectly by phillip seymour hoffman was one of the most unique yet entertaining characters in recent memory this movie informedyet managed to avoid preaching to the audience it made me laugh made me sad made me feel alive and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie it takes no time to understand what is going on and takes you on roller coaster ride of genuine human emotion thought knew my history apparently didnt know it at all give this move out of and recommend it for all adults and young adults and the young at heart just not the young but as soon as they are allowed to see rated movies make it priority,positive

steven seagals films of late have not exactly been good but this is by far the worst since the patriot the plot makes no sense what so ever it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are who works for who or who is double crossing who the film is completely disjointed each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow most of the blame must lie at the directors feet for not even understanding the basics of film making but seagal does not get off lightly as one of the producers of this film he must also share the blame oh and havent even mentioned how awful the acting is even by seagal standards even as straight to video fodder this is not worth view even for seagal fans give it wide berth,negative
and for one think that is good thing ive just never been rosalind russell fan although the original was my favorite rr movie but love bette and was thrilled to hear she was making thisas for the rest of the production think it was slightly less than the original movie one of my favorite minor characters in the original was mazeppa with her scratchy fingernailsontheblackboard voice belting out hey it takes lot more than no talent to be strippah and although missed it was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do carbon copyi also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at stage it gives feeling that you are in the theatre not just at the moviesi think the other thing liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song let me entertain you which becomes completely annoying after about the 5th time you hear it,positive

friend lent me this dvd which he got from the director at festival think went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great so maybe that colored my judgment but have to admit that liked this moviethe standouts where the actors youssef kerkor was really good as ernie the main character kind of pathetic in likable way adam jones who also directed and justin lane were excellent as the roommates who drive ernie mad the bill character justin lane who spends lot of the film dressed like panda was by far my favorite he seemed the least onedimensional and reminded me of an old college roommate so much called the guy after watching the dvd really kind of lovable and very funny some of the other acting was good some was soso but none of it was bad also really liked the vigilante duo ridiculous and funnyim giving this one high marks even though it has some issues because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared and decided to make their movie their way well done to adam jones and crew,positive

cinemas greatest period started in postwar europe with italys neorealist movement during the next or decades that followed frances new wavers caught everyones attention and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere making bitter masterpieces but in luchino visconti brought the artform to full circle geographically speaking with his miraculous work death in venice which might as well be called the death of europoean cinema after the sixties wound down so did the great european filmmakers who with some exceptions generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to new american generation of movie brats coppola scorsese co this movie absolutely feels like grand summingup not just of viscontis particular obsessions but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies and rest assured you will find no sterner taskmaster than the visconti revealed here hes not playing to the crowd folks either you get behind him and follow along or you get left behind the pacing is challenge slow but never without emotional weight incidents are few and far between but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in sturmunddrang cosmoswe will probably never be in such rarefied company again in terms of the movies one of the centurys great writers who inspired the tale thomas mann one of the greatest filmmakers directing it visconti one of the greatest actors in the lead role dirk bogarde and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background gustav mahlers 5th symphony taking full advantage of mahlers ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast visconti changes the main character aschenbach into decrepit composer from his original persona as writer even making bogarde up to look like mahler geeky mustache specs shaggy hair ducklike walk bogarde by the way delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies its largely silent performance and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in gesture or glance difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpsecinema just doesnt get better than this ill ignore the complaints from the ritalinaddicts out there who say that its too slow but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbachs flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced the flashbacks fit neatly within the movies thematic concerns ie which is the better path to aesthetic perfection passion or discipline and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers of course some viewers will sleep through this movie anyway nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful dying venice would be nothing more than pretty picture but this movie is actually about something and what its mostly about is suffering romantic capital suffering in particular as suffering romantic himself visconti knew whereof he spokespoiler guess if for nothing else see death in venice for its portentous opening credits and for its unforgettable ending with bogardes jetblack hairdye dripping off of his sweaty dying head and onto his chalkwhite face meanwhile off in the distance young tadzio the object of bogardes dying desire stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like michelangelo sculpture the climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about love lust beauty loss the ending of life set against the beginning of another life and cold death in the midst of warm sunny beauty death in venice is miraculous work of art dvd tip as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece the damned recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie its ostensibly in english but the dvds sound seems muddy and theres lot of italian spoken during the film anyway,positive
this is stereotype plot young fighter tries to enter competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school this leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds strange new master to teach him to fightthe fights are not of high standards they are way too simple in way that is simple to every adult the fighter has trained and enters the ring but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking the coach yells do this and do that with no success and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once this results in turning point in the fight although our hero has been taking beating of his life up until that point think about the rocky movies and youll have good point of reference of how much beating he really takes the fights are also shot poorlythere final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance cheesy music and awkward moments are not what call entertainmentthese guys really could have made some quality entertainment but the director wasnt up to the task or the other crew in my opinion maybe they had small budget dont know but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of out of,negative

it isnt too bad but ultimately it lacks the quality that the australian series hasthe jokes are few and far between the actors are attractive they shouldnt be the film makers think far too much about the cinematography its supposed to look like home video and its just like serious version of kath and kim its stupidits too normal to be kath and kim kath and kim are supposed to be two curvy middleaged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes there are no look at me kimmy jokes the fat friend of kim is not fat at all and shes not even slightly stupid shes stereotypical blacklatino chickits just not as stupid or funny as the australian series it doesnt compare nothing is the same admit this show is pretty funny at times but it is not anything like the aussie series was looking forward to an american take on bogan family they failed its supposed to be really stupid and hilarious but the actors dont act stupid to me this is just typical american tv show its let down if you want it to be anything like the aussie show2 stars because it is an okay show just nothing like what it should be,negative
from the decrepit ranks of the already oversaturated hillybilly horror subgenre comes this woeful tale of vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks sound familiar well it most definitely should to anyone with even cursory knowledge of the horror genre there is absolutely new here the film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clichés deformed hicks peaceful family turned guntoting killers when push comes to show the rebellious daughter the one freak whos good at heart etcetera but does even that halfheartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time this is forgettable dreck but humorously enough lead jd hart once starred in movie called films that suck earlier in his career quite an ironic omen indeedmy grade,negative

this film is where the batman franchise ought to have stopped though will concede that the ideas behind batman forever were excellent and could have been easily realised by competent director as it turned out this was not to be the caseapparently warner brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turned out apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from burton and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixties tv series fail to understand how batman returns can be considered at all disappointingtrue it is not quite the equal of the first film though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in batman weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson as the joker in the first film yet for all this it remains gorgeously dark film true to the way the batman was always meant to be and highly satisfyingmichael keaton returns as the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne tangling with nouveau riche tycoon max schreck christopher walken named in honour of the 1920s german silent actor his partnerincrime oswald cobblepot the penguin danny devito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of laurence oliviers richard iii and selina kyle the catwoman michelle pfeiffer whom wayne romances both as himself and as the batman the four principals turn in excellent performances especially walken and devito while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identitiesthere are some intriguing concepts in this film about the only weakness can really point out is certain limpness to the script in some places which think is due mostly to the way this film is fourcornered fight there simply isnt enough time to properly explore whats going onnevertheless this is damn good film highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under burton and keaton,positive

was stunned by this film afterwards didnt even want to see any films for long time any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparisonfor many it may be the worst of antonioni very slow without an engaging conventional story line microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions and the worst of wenders verbose confused transcendentalism it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by wenders typical meandering heros stream of consciousness so it doesnt produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinemabut for fans the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching single poetic image that stretches across the film wenders and antonioni create discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things,positive

this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film ive seen in full the first was rope which really enjoyed with saboteur hitchcock was more room to roam free whereas rope took place all in one room didnt enjoy this one as much as rope but thats not saying this is bad film it just seems like an average flick that could have been something moreit seems like film hitchcock would make as break in between his more serious ones as thriller feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states the climax of the film feels like miss opportunity to really amp up the tension the sound design is almost non existent you can hear their dialogue and bit of the environment around them but the important things are missing the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve the need of music to amp of the tension all missing intentional no doubt yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such scene then it ends abruptly leaving you empty insidethe film doesnt feel like it should either they are almost globe trotting from place to place yet it feels more confined the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot movingthe performances are there but nothing amazing everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work the one stand out is otto kruger who has that rich ego evil persona down patin the end wanted more from this one understand its one of hitchcocks least exciting films but did have good time watching it can recommend it just not enthusiastically,positive
it is always difficult to bring pages book down to three hours film read the book before and found the bbc production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible the qualities of the book havent been lost the dense and lively depiction of fingersmith patchwork family in london in the 1860s the cold and obscene cruelty in which maud is brought up the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking the unexpected and surprising twists of the story the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from sues point of view then from mauds one the main actors do very good and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed with first culmination in very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other because they still love each otherfor each of her books the author sarah waters has thoroughly investigated what life was like in british 19th century while in tipping the velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements in affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits in fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in london and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research this is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show high grade of historic truth highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful victorian atmosphere vivid emotions and suspense,positive

let me first off say that am believer of ghosts and do indeed know they exist have had enough experiences with them to know they are therewhat hate is the people who bring the bible and religion into all of this people forget there is more than one bible thousands of religions and beliefs and different ways to interpret what is said in the bible not everyone believes in god and not everyone believes in stereotypical religion religion does not make everything fact one of the things should mention in the bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant bible thumper is breaking the very rules written withinyou are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time slavery is ok and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances none of this oh that was the old testament and now we have the new testament if the bible is the word of god and cannot be changedthere should be no changes or versions religion is full of misinterpretations mixed facts and people who so blindly follow it that there is no other way the excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their pastor or teacher but anyhow onto the review am decent fan of ghost hunters and when heard this show was coming soon was pretty excited and thought it had some potential as much as like watching ghost hunters do not like some of their members and do not like the way they can dismiss place as being haunted yet cannot explain anything that is going on just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up does not mean the camera filming the show did not am glad they are skeptical but its like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not if ghosts were that easy to capture it would be known as fact not belief its more of right place at the right time kind of thing as well as if there is something there what makes you think its going to perform for you this show is kind of silly its usually boring and there is lots of talk lots of psychics yet hardly anything happens the main guys filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to or is basically not neededalso the reliance on psychics is too abundant as believe very few of them are actually gifted silvia brown is one definitely believe in but most are sometimes hard to believei really wanted to like this show but of the few have seen have yet to be terribly impressed,negative
for long time the menagerie was my favorite star trek episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by city on the edge of forever what used to prefer about menagerie was that its more hardcore star trek with this fascinating backstory to the thencurrent trek storyline still think its fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into twopart episode though the new part of the story is largely an excuse for kirk and few others and us to watch the pilot the idea of spock being courtmartialed is clever one you can poke holes in the plot if you want for instance given the talosians mindcontrol abilities and captain pikes condition why is it even necessary to physically bring pike back to their planet and there are other confusing questions about pike and commodore mendez best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy sts only twoparter,positive

when it was released this film caused sensation watched it and was thrilled beautiful usually young naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director hamiltons photography his photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie today saw it again and was bitterly disappointed the soft core in extremely slow paced scenes all filmed with some vaseline on the lenses actually is all there is there is no real story the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies but they are not real creatures with soul actually nothing happens it is like hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills and this gets so boring after while even didnt watch the whole thing the second time for fell vast asleep that is all that remains of this masterpiece it is very good sleeping pill and you will never become addicted to itback then out of now out of,negative
largely forgettable tale in which mercenary kerman employer agren travel into the jungle in search of agrens missing sisterdespite its connection to the cannibal movie family this film is more of an extreme version of rene cardonas guyana crime of the century lenzi clearly aims to exploit the at that time topical jonestown massacre by depicting rogue self righteous zealot with penchant for bigamy and just hint of megalomania played with ruthless intensity by ivan rassimov leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion with sister in toe kerman agren attempt to stop the rot but after several failed coups they end up fleeing into the green inferno only to run afoul the locals and their notorious appetitesone in string of excessive gore fests that emerged in the late seventiesearly eighties where every new addition seemed to engage in oneupmanship contest with its predecessor by attempting to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion pictures this inferior instalment employs all the motifs and gimmicks of the others but with much less successwas it the so called amazonian natives who looked like they were bollywood rejects this film was made on location in sri lanka or the inept decapitation and castration scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was apparent in cannibal holocaust you can decide without spoiling the conclusion it appeared as though lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for cohesive ending where all loose ends are resolved most unsatisfyingas with the others where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited thankfully the filmmakers have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks unfortunately the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates mention among others of the ilk that deal with the subject matter more convincinglyif there are any redeemable features at all kerman is an affable if somewhat onedimensional leading man and his bevy of scantily clad costars agren lai and senatore provide some visual respite from the relentless slayings,negative
get smart should be titled get stupid there is not one funny line or gag in the entire film this film is so bad it makes the austin powers films look shakespearean few more films like this and steve carell can kiss his career goodbye as for anne hathaway what is she doing in this film shes good actress but is just plain terriblethe writing is pathetically lame there is not one funny clever or witty line there is not one good sight gagthe directing is terrible comedy relies on timing someone should tell the director that every line that is supposed to be funny and isnt is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing ive ever seen0 stars,negative
herculis puaro is in general well established hero we know well from books and movies this movie or this story dont work and felt its not agathas mistake the cast isnt good the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything even arab clothes look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as comedy instead of mystery drama the actor playing herculis puaro is doing nice job but nothing fantastic the scenes are as said before perfect and looking fake the story is not very enchanting although mystery of murder but who cares about the death of loony and vicious blond woman in the iraqi desert the victim is not likable,negative

this was by far the worst movie ive ever seen and thats compared to alexander fortress and the new worldi should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation as it was truly traumatic experience for the first ten minutes was changing the zoom on my widescreen tv because the actors seemed to be out of screen didnt think it was possible to make such bad film in this day and age was wrong while typing this message ive thought of good reason to buy this movie joke present at xmas im blaming the mrs for this one as she picked it thanks babebe warneda true shocker all round,negative
if youve read mother night and enjoyed it so much as did that you just have to see the movie understand that you have to understand fundamental element of vonnguts writing that beyond his story lies vonnegut himself and that you cant put human mind on the screen his whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by screenplay or even the best acting performance believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that vonnegut poses in his book but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen does this mean that the movie misses the mark of course not in my opinion the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book this is not medium for those too lazy to turn page it succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of story created by one of americas true artistic treasures and presents it in framework without pretense ive seen other movie versions of vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel vonneguts genius and loses grip on his own craft would not place this movie as one of the best ive seen but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching by taking vonneguts voice out of the movies narration or trying to insert it however it can mother night tells his story brilliantly and preserves the storys fundamental lessons without confusion distraction or disappointment,positive
this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen not only that it is comedy which isnt funny but its also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effectsthe two heroes with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite lot that they touched each others genitals all the time but the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal by referring to german history and to show sensitive aspects of the heroes which finds its climax in showing how erkan and stefan cure mentally ill woman with their joyful lifestyle but hadnt expect anything better by director michael bully herbig who also made two not funny tvshows not funny western movie and nearly not funny sfcomedy movie but erkan and stefan had been just little better in some of their standup programs for me the only good thing about the movie is alexandra neldel who is very beautiful to me,negative
sat through this on tv hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the timebut dear gussie whoever thought this script was worth producing the basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad with constantly illogical sequence of scenes an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor rock hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face looks like bad movie from the 40s,negative
number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between stewart and novak she was and he was when this movie was released think that the difference didnt matter for suspense drama like vertigo but it does matter for romantic comedy we can easily understand that is why his character would be attracted to hers but its less clear why hers would be attracted to hisstill the movie works as light romantic fantasy the scene where she stares at him across the cats head with her dark paintedon eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring is true magic its little jarring therefore when the scene shifts to the top of the flatiron building and we see the age difference very sharply as he embraces her she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee,positive
family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about one man daddy has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity the kids grow upone all be it in the hard way to realize that no matter how old they or parent is the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them cushion when they fall all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances yes shed tear along the way knowing had had similar experiences both as young adult and later as parent this true to life is one which every young adult and parent would do well to see although some will not realize it until they too are parents must see for those who care about their families,positive
the only conceivable flaw of this film is its title please stop comparing it to the first did in my previous review only to separate it from the first if you havent seen the movie and are curious totally forget about the first and invent different name for this there is nothing alike and has mood all its own this is great exponent of screwy mid80s comedy seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first anybody who ever wanted to give kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus maintain the only reason this is in the imdb bottom is because of its title usually hate movies like these ie adam sandler will farrell farrelly bros but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically dunno maybe its like bad relationship cant get out of or just ridiculous guilty pleasure either way this is the single most underrated movie of the 80s behind the stunt manrobert stack we love you,positive
salva and his pal bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives we see them panhandling in car of the underground where their pitch to get donations is so lame no one gives them anything salva who is hardened petty criminal doesnt even have any redeeming qualities that is until he discovers reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next religion and show business prove to be winning combination something that salva capitalizes onhe and bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of priest that was critical of the duo salva shows he is natural for the reality show he transforms himself into christlike figure who is an instant success in the program espe who is nononsense woman who is shows producer cant escape from the way salva pays her unusual attention ultimately salva is the victim of his own success in the endjordi molla whose first directorial job this movie is had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television spain which was vulnerable to these types of programs has seen its share of the bizarre which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making fortune out of the naive audiencethe ensemble cast has some good moments in the film mr molla like any actor who decides to direct his first feature would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera candela pena good actress is one of the best reasons for watching the movie juan carlos villedo david gimenez cacho franco francescoantonio florinda chico and the rest responded well to the new director,positive
these kinda movies just dont get the credit they deserve this is my 2nd all time favorite movie stand by me being 1st the reason watched this movie was because wil wheaton was in it and he is my most favorite person in the whole world and think he done an amazing job in this movie and so did sean astin just watched it last night actually and it just amazed me everything in the movie is very exceptional the script the acting the screenplay was on the edge of my seat of the time and if my mom wasnt in the room would have absolutely balled whenever joey trotta wil wheaton died did not see that coming at all was real surprised when heard that it wasnt real popular back in the 90s was born few years after it came out so of course didnt go see it in the theaters but im sure would have if would have been alive if any of my friends watched this they would be like uhh okay but thats just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this if you havent seen this movie or are wanting to watch something that is the bomb this is the movie for you to watch,positive
as bigtime prince fan of the last three to four years really cant believe ive only just got round to watching purple rain the brand new 2disc anniversary special edition led me to buy it wow was really looking forward to watching it but wasnt prepared for just how electric it actually is princes musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding he really has the moves in this one am very familiar from repeated listens with the classic purple rain album and all its songs but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics like computer blue the beautiful ones when doves cry and purple rain itself there is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where prince and the revolution perform the closing songs baby im star and would die for show how much energy and sheer talent prince was brimming with in his mid20s hes overflowing it blew me away it even makes michael jackson seem inanimate even in his peak yearsprince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams drive her to lake make her jump in then drive off absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsightsome of the scenes are very 1980s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the films overall charm morris day is the coolest cat on the block and hilarious and when his group the time perform the bird you get to see morris day and jerome benton light up the stage minneapolis funk style love their dancing in this bit and how benton provides morris with mirror midperformancei already cant wait to watch it again really cant extras are terrific particularly seeing young eddie murphy prebeverly hills cop admit he is prince groupie,positive
good ol boy film is almost required to have moonshine car chases storyline that has vague resemblance to plot and at least one very pretty country gal barefoot with short shorts and low top the pretty gal is here dressed in designer jeans but the redneck prerequisites stop there jimmy dean is natural as sausage spokesman but as tough guy former sheriff he comes up way short big john is big but he isnt convincing with the bad part of his moniker bugeyed jack elam is hoot as always and bo hopkins has been playing this same part for decades ned beatty also does his part in small role but there is no story it smells more like an episode of in the heat of the night than feature film cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie is charlie daniels singing the theme you know the one it was made famous by jimmy dean,negative
after several extremely well ratings to the point of superb was extremely pleased with the film the film was dark moving the anger the pain the guilt and very extremely convincing demoni had initially expected to see many special effects and like lovers caress it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it brian am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects you will go long way my friend will definitely be the president of your fan cluberic etebari the best actor award was the number one choice you made jr lopez look like child compared to kasadya overall the acting story line the high quality filming and awesome effects it was fantastic just wish it were longer am looking forward to the dreamless with extremely high expectations,positive
but it is kinda hilarious at least if you grew up on weird al like did its mockumentary about his life and career beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins its uneven in places but some of the segments are still very funny particularly when he goes to japan although its not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation and he doesnt find love however fleeting he does capture in bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street lifeperhaps weird al isnt recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is perhaps rose by any other name would smell just as sweet still this is funny movie,positive

managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november with my boyfriend we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving it was very well directed with strong imagery the visual effects were amazing especially for short it had an original fantasy approach to very real and serious topic this film is about young girl who is visited by demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father there is also surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard this leans towards the gothic feel would love to see this as full feature film carrie,positive

minimal script minimal character development minimal steady camera maximum stretched scenes maximum headache inducing jerky zooms maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing up until the time flashes on the screen of 1201pm you can fast forward and miss nothing since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing to be fair the movie does have some string music that was interesting so perhaps music video would have been the way to go with this unfortunately that was not to be and what should have been twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief forget about trigger man know am trying to merk,negative
wonderful film ahead of its timei think so in the eightys it was all about winning greed is good remember that one have seen this film more that times to me this is real desert island film keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that just love jessica tandy and hume cronin are simply wonderfulalso beverly dangelo beau bridges come in at close second dont get me wrong there are many more great performances in this film and it is also the way it is written that made it for me and hope you film that you will want to see over and over think tv shows like northen exposure and now earl owe lot to this film but remember it is not tom cruise film,positive

this is one of the more unromantic movies have ever seencasting richard gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore diane looks bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself supporting cast not too memorablestory the medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting the story is weak not enough happens to make movie about there is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here the setting is little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive not destined to be great one to remember,negative
only light spoilers in herestealing sinatra is halfslapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers dimwit victims and few other sidestories thrown in to eat up some timeyou will see some poor performances all around in this movie the drama is forced and the humor makes no sense whether youre watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who wont shut up or victims father responding to the criminals death threat with care for some tea none of it is believable this quite comfortably fits into the wannabe movie categoryyou will also be listening to repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie its quite unprofessional and adds nothing its really just sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat wittyhowever if youre able to look past all of this and suspend lot of disbelief you might be entertained by the adequate storylinei voted,negative
yes this is one of those movies so terrible so insipid so trite that you will not be able to stop laughing have watched comedies good comedies and laughed less than my wife and laughed at this movie the other comments give the idea well enough the characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge the acting oh the acting talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pausesbut the rat yes the big rat why we didnt get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me often the big one isnt shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money surmise however that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was guy running around dressed up like woodchuck with thirdworld dentistrythe most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene after figuring out that the rats couldnt stand loud noise migraines from the bad acting the main dude rigs up fire alarm to send the rats into frenzy if youve ever wanting to see pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like geyser this film is for you really you need to rent it and see for yourselfbut not for more than ok,negative

following directly from where the story left off in part one the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the mans legacy is exactly as such in direct contrast to the first feature part two represents shift from che the pride and glory of revolutionised country to chestruggling liberator of country to which he has no previous ties the change of setting isnt just aesthetic from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes change of tone and heart to the feature replacing the optimism of the predecessor with cynical battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle yet as che would go on to say himselfsuch struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that part two takes much more refined callous and bleak segment of ches life and ambition and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in tangible easy to grasp mannerwhile the movies tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however there still remains that same documented approach taken month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible this somewhat distant cold approach to telling ches story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off indeed still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything the entirety of che taken as whole delivers tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents mans struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way by no means does soderbergh try to paint humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half decade ago excuse the ironic contrast che is slow moving reserved and meditative approach to telling history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably conducted the whole thingyet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two the story does inevitably take on distinctly contrasting tone that doesnt feel too disjointed from its predecessor but does enough to give it its own reference points here the basic structure of part one is echoed backtheres the initial struggle the battles the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement yet as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know part two is destined to end on much more underwhelming and disquieting note this difference in combination with the similarities to part one make compelling and memorable whole by all means both could be digested one their own and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such and enjoyed as they are but taken as one statement che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieveindeed everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building realistically structured combat scenesthe drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible but with feature such as this part two once again proves that avoiding such elements dont necessarily hurt film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged in fact upon writing this review was at odds as to whether or not to simply add paragraph or two to my initial review for part one and title the review as whole yet felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutivelywith that said cannot rightfully decree whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime but upon viewing both segments can at least attest to each parts ability to do just that with reflective intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movies characters without drawing attention to themselves che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor but this time with tragic but uplifting reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film review by jamie robert ward httpwwwinvocusnet,positive

shallow grave begins with either tribute or rip off of the shower scene in psycho im leaning toward rip off after that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better almost to the point of being original bad acting and amateurish directing bog down fairly interesting little story but the film already surpasses many in the yankee comes down south to get killed by bunch of rednecks genre because it is actually shot in the southa group of college girls head to ft lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in georgia by flat tire after getting off the main road note to yankees stay on the highway when you go to florida sue ellen lisa stahl has to pee so she heads into the woods when she finally finds good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff tony march strangle his mistress merry rozelle to death note to yankees do not wander off into the woods when in the south not because you might witness murder but you may run across marijuana plantation this is the point where the story not the movie actually comes close to being goodwhile tony march will never have to practice his oscar speech his sheriff dean becomes creepy facsimile of normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do tom law is likable as deputy scott and is as authentic southern deputy as ive seen since walton goggins deputy steve naish in house of corpsesa few scenes in the movie are worth the mention the girls stop at bbq in south carolina and display their racism when big black guy checks them out sue ellen runs into barn to hide behind some hay bales and in shockingly realistic moment large snake is hiding in the hay with herand in the strangest scene sheriff dean makes like hes about to rape patty carol cadby and tells her to take off her clothes dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what hes about to do the preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his bible his sermon is about how jezebel is saved by the blood of jesus christ feel sorry for this preachers flock jezebel was in the old testament few thousand years before christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in heaven,negative
although this film has had lot of praise personally found it boring there are some nice brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable but the story of how they interrelate even if very unusual by our standards is not interesting enough to sustain movie this long the central woman takes up with one man after another in close knit way and putting the interests of her children first as the tolerance of the various men is stretched we see their characters develop the story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting it is rare glimpse into the brasilian hinterland far from the city but hardly exciting enough to keep ones eyes open for,negative

have to point out before you read this review that in no way is this statement against iranian people if you really want to read something into it than hopefully you see that im against politicians in general but if youre looking to be offended cant help younot in iran as this movie is banned there see imdb trivia for this movie which is shame because the movie is great would it not be for grbavica this movie would have won at the international film festival in berlinrightfully so it was the runnerup or second place if you will why because it is movie about oppression its not even that this is complete women issue it is about the government trying to keep the people down an analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie but by banning it nothing is resolved andor can they make this movie disappear another reviewer had great summary line comedy about tragedy that sums it up pretty well,positive
know little or nothing about astronomy but nevertheless was at first little sceptical about the plot of this movie it follows three children that were all born during solar eclipse and so have no emotion and thus naturally become ruthless serial killers the plot does sound ridiculous at first but once you realise that solar eclipse blocks out saturn and as you know saturn is the emotion planet it all falls into place makes complete sense and its then that you know you arent simply watching another silly 80s slasher with pea brain plot thank god for that seriously though bloody birthday is based on ridiculous premise but it more than makes up for that with its originality having bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema but when given the choice between this and another dull friday the 13th clone know what id choosealso helping the film out of the hole that some people would think its silly plot dug it into is the fact that its extremely entertaining many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore this film however keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids which harks back to creepy kid classics such as village of the damned constant stream of sick humour and small but impressive for the type of film dose of suspense and tension one thing that liked lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry theres nothing worse than slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again cough halloween cough but thats not the case here as bloody birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows there wasnt any room for chainsaw which is huge shame but suppose not every film can have chainsaw in it,positive
after many many years saw again this beautiful love story thinking about how would half century after react to film which made so many girls cry and sigh at that time when was just an male adolescent trying to understand womens behaviors in small city in brazilthis time however what caught my attention in the film was something very different namely the insistence with which the physician dr han suyin jennifer jones makes clear to the journalist mark elliott william holden her special ethically condition as an eurasian in fact she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in occidental way provided that by doing so she is not betraying her chinese side its seems to the spectator that suyin is eagerly making efforts to establish very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at minimum failure in her attempts to control themtherefore suyins attitudes always leave poor elliott determined brave and extremely practical man anxious and perplexed without knowing how much importance to give to her words for him whose love for her is plain and simple the situation is totally clear if we love each other let us make couple and begin immediately life together not so fast is what she seems verbally and nonverbally to answer him all the timein fact suyins chinese portion would never allow her such level of pragmatism and as she goes on and on reinforcing this much aimed equilibrium between those two worlds inside herself she also frequently signals to him that also very peculiar trait of chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind namely the constant raids on the real world by invisible beings from an spiritual or nonphysical world for suyin is always alerting elliott about how dangerous is life not because of any objective and concrete threat as would be the perpetuation of the english colonialism or the eminence of japanese invasion but due to the threats of plenty of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor fearful and vulnerable human beingsin fact it looks like whole bunch of chinese deities are permanently on the watch to make peoples life totally miserable because of that mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls clothes so that they are not taken away by jealous gods everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon peasants are advised that they should shout loudly the rice is bad the rice is bad to protect their crops from being stolen by deities and in funeral it is recommended that the deads family be isolated from the other people by curtains so that the gods dont take advantage of their sorrow and fragilityin other words suyin introduces us to culture in which the supernatural has real existence as if rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic gods are always on the verge of negatively interfering with the most banal acts in anyones daily lifeas the story takes place in hong kong in it should be clear that china really was at that time almost semifeudal society while the country from which elliott had come from was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that launched by the usa after the first oil shock in took charge of the whole world therefore at least in one aspect both sides of suyins eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be todaya lot of history came into being since those old days as to china the main fact is that after several phases of communist regime the country finally reached in the last two decades the condition of very aggressive economy much more properly described as state capitalism and what happened to that old spirituality that so much enthralled suyin in hong kong in and with which she used to impress so much an impassioned elliott under that tree on the hill behind the hospital it is gone completely gone in brief if that story took place today elliott would not find it necessary to go to china to propose to suyin in the presence of the third uncle and her entire family in fact both men would now be incomparably closer to one another in their huge pragmatism talking business as usual,positive
first and foremost would like to say that before watched this film considered myself an accepting individual someone that cared about others appreciated others found nobarely any judgment against other people and this film has think changed my life or viewpoint dramatically when watched it didnt know particularly what it was about knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship but other then that was clueless and as began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters was in shock disbelief confusion and surprise the first time watched it was blind blind to their love to their intimacy to their connection to their pureness as human beings to their relationship watched it second time because finally figured out how hypocritical was being saying to myself and others oh accept all types of people and try not to judge them while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story because of my fear suppose the second time watched this film opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time and really looked not at the type of taboo relationship part that id heard about all my life but simply at two human beings in love and loved it loved the storyline loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film loved the sharing of feelings and loved the strong bonds created it is really eye opening beautifully done film that made me cry at times and hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually remember that everyone deserves love no matter what shape or form it is presented in,positive
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz if imdb would allow oneword reviews thats what mine would be this film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film the singing the story everything is dull and washed outjust like this public domain print like other comedy team films with roots in traditional kids stories such as the awful snow white and the three stooges and the overrated babes in toyland this movie has limited appeal and just doesnt age well now that think about it seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable so my advice is dont watch this film if you must watch an abbott and costello film almost any other one of their films except for ac go to mars would be an improvement,negative

hard to imagine this film is based on true story and how christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heartstirring daniel daylewis is chameleon really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character watching him on screen is shocking and breathtaking experiencethe movie is not so pessimistic as thought before the story is kinda bright and intriguing christy is not despised by the normals his life is also colorful and delightful although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyesone important factor of christys success is his mothers support which seems to be more touching and the unknown actress brenda fricker also deserves her oscar award for this role this fat little middleaged woman uses her all to make christys dream come true so lucky for christyand hugh oconor is also excellent as young christy what performance for child the love story of christy is very welldone trustful christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love his crush on the beautiful dr eileen cole surprisingly played by fiona shaw am deeply impressed with her role in harry potter series the loathsome aunt petunia so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind but anyway any woman has her own youth is paranoiac and offensive do have sympathy for him love is twoedged sword happiness and agony are just next to each otherbtw jim sheridans works are all good in america the boxer etc except get rich or die trying god knows why he chose to direct that crap really career taint for him what pity,positive
im stunned that the reviewers imdb gave this tv film as high rating as they did its an innocuous sweet uncomplicated cliché of film that had two big names from the past in it both of whom did decent job but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels like good romance as well as anyone but as my wife and were watching thisand before we saw the ratingwe said there are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because theres nothing in it to challenge their brains their faith their comfort level or their cultural preferences its possible to make good film like that and away from her is an example but this was amateur hour there are some quite good films rated much lower than this one truly another in long line of woefully inadequate holiday films watch the family stone its miles ahead of this schlock,negative

went to see this one with much expectation quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest even child can see the missing logic to characters behaviors todays kids need creative stories which would inspire them which would make them daydream about the events thats precisely what happened with movies like et and star wars decade ago how many kids imagined about becoming jedi knights and igniting their own lightsabers seriously dont waste your time money on this one,negative

after the highs of darkplace it was never conceivable that holness and adobye would be able to create anything half as good as garth marengi yet think that man to man in its own right is as good show on the good episodes as darkplace cant argue that of the episodes really arent that good but the other certainly make up for it if had to pick great episodes id go for formula4 driver steve pising pronounced pissing and the great garth marengi to already have bit of understanding of the programme is real plus as dean learner makes many inside jokes but even if you havent seen much dean id recommend this as some of the rants he launches into are genius ie his argument with def lepord over their name all in all great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes,positive
saw this movie in theater while on vacation in pablo co had just quit my biomedical engineering job at hospital consider the script to be exaggeration of the real type of stuff that goes on in hospitals the idiots that put it down on production value dont get the point and probably have never been hospitalized and never worked in one for sure billy jack same era was very poorly produced but had significant social comment and was very good movie with real social messagei have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site have found where it get mentioned,positive
caught this on television one day when was young and loved it in the 1970s there were bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was nice surprise its one of the best comedies of the 1970s and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to murrarys excellent comedic performance which still stands as one of his greatest this is the film that really got ivan reitman noticed as director reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time while this film is hilarious and meatballs is so bad that its fun meatballs and meatballs are absolutely dreadful recommended for those who enjoyed stripes and ghostbusters,positive
the films design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country us we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film befittingly the obvious of student vs teacher is present but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships male vs female white vs black and the individual vs society but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual vs himself was amazed at how bilateral point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides it did not attempt to show how either was right although would say the skin heads were shown much crueler and vindictive quite obvious towards the end the film also discusses sex and rape it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together for time lawrence fishburne does an overthetop performance as the sagacious profesor phipps he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and downtrodden with the industrious and positive other stars that make this film are omar epps ice cube and jennifer connelly michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can acthigher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting piece of paper in fact would say the film is almost satire in showing students interactions with each other rather than some dry book as the real education at university it is lifelearning process not textual one think youll find higher learning is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general,positive

the screenplay is the worst part of this film as it lurches from one premise to the next missing all the important bits that would have made number of different stories possible this film is confusing because the audience doesnt know what the story is had no problem with the lowproduction values and the acting wasnt great but this is telly so it was fine dont mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take but having such nonsensical screenplay is completely unnecessary did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash avoid this at all coststhe prologue in particular was so poorly written it needed voiceover to fill in all the details that had been left out the prologue was rushed it wasnt clear what was happening ie the russian revolution was reduced to some riots are happening in petersburg with the next scene being soldiers arresting them know the basic history of the revolution so could fill in the details those pesky communists the prologue is best ignoredthis could have been thoughtful study of person who is confused about who she is it sets up this premise in the asylum it could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film no gone the film assumes she is who she says she is even though there is still no empirical evidence it sets up melodramatic romance love so strong itll believe anything she says okay soppy romance no because it makes no sense the love interest seems like crazed and incidentally sleazy lunatic bursting out in wild gestures this also doesnt work because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end they never got married and she returned to america the love story collapses despite there being plenty of love scenes was never convinced of the reason that they were in love find romcom romances more convincing despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that theyve even spent any time with each otherit could have been thrillertype thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is and she struggles to prove her identity no the court case is summed up rather than dealt with the bizarre voice over comes back again to fill in the details of better filmthe funniest thing to consider is what really happened anna anderson was loony who went to america and married another loony and they did crazy things together throughout her life she had bouts of lunatic behaviour none of this in the film either theres really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as one flew over the cuckoos nexttwelve monkeystype informant thankfully she vanishes having brought nothing to the story,negative

wow whats this on the video rental stores shelf in front of me nothing other than questionable sequel to 8mm it wasnt very good sequel to movie that had very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this moviebasically from the plot outline verbatim an american diplomat david huxley and his fiancée tish harrington venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with porno video taken of them with prostitute risa the entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city the mystery is solved when in the end tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and essentially later on in the story her fiancée which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter endi didnt like how this had nothing to do with the original 8mm at all the only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was the fact that david ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene otherwise its totally different movie it made for lousy love story even before the end is known which makes the ending more of possibility because didnt believe the words coming out of davids mouth the whole time but we were warned that he was liar about most things that might get him in troublethere were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the shocking moments of the film which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this hellish sex debauchery counted at least ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown even the menu screen on the dvd is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the dvd seem totally provocativedavid was no heroic person throughout the film you could guess he was the main problem long before the end the actors who played each role were all new to me which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting respect there were plot holes how did david and richard finally impress tishs father by getting the lease they wanted when david was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find prostitute there were cheesy technology moments like the talking email program dressed up like bondage queen and gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get joaquin phoenix knockoff to play this character the tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete bs too because it wasnt even about last breath nobody really dies but they did have good car crash sequence that came out of nowherebut that was good seconds long out of an hour and long moviego rent and maybe buy the original its one of joel schumachers better and more original films it has everything better about it from this film wouldnt recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges,negative
ok honestly dont see why everybody thinks this is so great its really not there were two good things that came out of this movie jacks performance he was very good can tip my hat for him dannys performance he was good no other then that it got pretty stupid and what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy she was so bad she looked the same every time she got scared the problem with this movie was the ending would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently and the over all movie was just stupid the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off,negative
this episode had potential the basic premise of woman living next door to an empty apartment but phone that constantly rings is somewhat interesting and when she explores the noise there is genuine tension and fear but stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode hadfirst of all the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction eg its funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind this door has serious damage to it that wasnt here minute ago the door opened by itself without me touching it etc given these supernatural phenomena plus the fact that woman committed suicide in the room wouldnt she take some precaution before entering it maybe she could investigate in the day time or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else or maybe she could turn on the lights also while in the haunted apartment she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide just unplug the phone the phone company doesnt need to be involved walk up to the phone and unplug it case closedfinally showing the phone scamper across the floor like its alive was just comical if the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card he couldve done it in way that didnt look cartoony brave little toaster anyone,negative

first remember bumping into this zaniness from the zucker brothers and jim abrahams back in the early days at comedy central back in those days the 90s their programming consisted of benny hill reruns and the original mst3k complete with bearded hostcapt frank drebin played by the stonefaced deadpan filibuster leslie nielson is process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists think dragnet meets starsky hutch the show boiled in flask full of wellknown police television show plots and scenarios this is distilled times to produce the most pure policeman every made forget about simon pegg in hot fuzz for now save it for later frank drebin is clueless at most times terrible driver terrible shot macho yet sensitive and vulnerable he is master of the police investigative methodology aka ask johnny the leathery old shoeshine boy this does not make him bad cop cops get lucky also capt drebin notice hes captain here has perfected it along with his partner nordberg and the rest of force perfectly parody the police drama over the course of golden episodesthe show is treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quoteables most of the sight gags are bit dated and silly the magic never came from the sight gagshowever at its core was nonsensical and straightfaced conversation and activities in the foreground with crazy things occurring in the background the movies can best be described as minute compilations of the best gags from this series think of monty pythons and now for something completely differentif you liked airplane naked gun or top secret then you will definitely enjoy this always liked the series better than the movies even though saw the movies first why words no oj,positive
guy desperate for action attempts to hit on gorgeous girl in bus she refuses him but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway and there it starts relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is jealous and neurotic superhero it cant be secret that things between them are going to be problematicin short story that could promise to grow out into cool film and imo it succeeds at being nice film its no masterpiece but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion the two lead characters twirl around each other in crazy love fest that is even with the superhero thing going believableso thin story but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time7 out of broken hearts,positive
think it is great one of my favourite films as kid and who said there songs were unforgettable they were mint can still remember them now word for word the film remains favourite with my family and my younger cousins are now addicted to it too they even know the songs this film is great and enjoyable film for kids it has moral lesson so dont say its not good because it shows how lying gets you nowhere ill leave with parting comment this film is amazing love me xxx ps would like the soundtrack but cant and yes the animation is good the jokes are humorous and the action never stopsthis film will go down in childrens film history and in my opinion one of the only remaining safe films to show children,positive
the film someone had to makewaco the rules of engagement dissects the evidence behind the standoff in waco texas that led to the destruction of the branch davidian homestead and the alleged government coverupthe first thing you need to know about this film you will see brief but disturbing photos of the victims bodies this is not done for shock value but to illustrate points about the way they died as if you were present at the coroners inquestthe second thing you should know about this film at two and quarter hours its pretty ponderous especially if you already followed the events closely at the time if you are unaware of any of the events other than what was reported in the mass media or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report this may be essential viewing if on the other hand you want more concise albeit unapologetically one sided version of events you should see waco the big liein summary this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event and is very sobering but as work of filmmaking could test your patience especially if you have short attention span and its at times superfluous for those who watched the cspan hearings and the minutes reportsperhaps someday someone will make documentary that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story such as the bizarre chain of events that led up to the atf raid or the psychological warfare tactics the fbi used blasting rock music at the sect and their charismatic leaders all rock musicians themselves picking up their instruments and turning their massive amplifiers outward to blast their own music right back at them,positive
what good movie at last picture revealing unknown side of rock illusions of fame wellknown rockers are getting old and forgotten not the music and with good sense of humour have you ever danced on bill haleys rock around the clockanyway still crazy is probably the best movie about rock nroll have ever seen far much better than spinal tap for instance why because in still crazy people are mature they have different point of view about rock about love and about life they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much beyond the story itself we see characters with their own personality weaknesses and dreams like anyone of usspend good time watching this listen to the awesome soundtrack and finally thinking of your own futurebye,positive
had it with the one who raised you since when you were young you just want her gone from your life that woman is your mother you should respect her you should honor her whether shes in sick or well but that in times it can be aggravating especially when she becomes very overbearing thats how owendanny devito had to deal with in throw momma fron the train his mommaanne ramsey is one of the worst he trying his best to be writer and she is everything but grateful calls him clumsy poop larda and fat and stupid for his friend larry donnerbilly crystal he has his own woman problems his exwife she trying to discredit him so what did owen do push her overboard what does he do help return the favor get rid of mrs lift in the kitchen scene liked it where owen called larry cousin patty and momma said you dont have cousin patty and owen shouts you lied to me and el cabongs larry with the frying pan then comes the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill momma lift that is thwarted and she kicks larry off the train well everything back to normal the exwife lives but momma kicked the bucket on her own maybe she should have seen the errors of her domineering ways fun movie it is and the cast is great classic stars,positive
yes it is bit cheesy but its suspenseful and entertaining and one of my favorites there are some excellent actors in the film and they do commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters its interesting to see david soul in bad guy role thought he was quite believableand rather chillingas the evermoreparanoid co robert conrad is longtime favoritei think he brings his character to life very well and sam waterston has been star quality in everything of his ive watchedmovies or tv watch this movie every so often but our tape vhs tv copy got is such poor quality its difficult to fully enjoy it this is movie think they should put out on dvd maybe it wouldnt be universally sought after but im sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there would be market for dvd version ill keep hoping,positive
so it isnt an epic but for people experiencing anything similarsibling suicide it might be an interesting way of therapy animaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time wellspent for some reason it hasnt really caught on in the audiencesomething do believe is result of the main theme why did shecommit suicide clearly this is hardly something that usmoviegoers will flock to had it been an european production itprobably would have reached its audience in much greaterextent it is however movie that although the realism tainted by ashimmering romanticized glow gives the viewer whole heartedimpression,positive
absolutely loved this film was hesitant to watch it at first because thought it would be too painful remember how hard it was when john was shot however watching the two of us took me back to happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what might have been aidan quinn was adorable as paul and met the challenge head on was impressed with his accent and mannerisms jared harris is also very talented and was quite believable as john my favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene which was so poignant the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction both of which feel are appropriate given the circumstances,positive
previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave much better recap of the films plot details than could what recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful in every sense emotionally visually editorially just gorgeousif you like movies that are wonderful to look at and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of arton scale of to id give it about an the only reason shy away from is that it is mood piece if you are in the mood for really artistic very romantic film then its definitely think its mustsee but none of us can be in that mood all the time so overall,positive
great premise poor execution cast of great actors is watered down into poorly written poorly directed poorly edited waste of film only redeeming quality is the numerous shots of the foodjoan chen mercedes ruehl kyra sedgwick and alfre woodard should fire their agents,negative
have to agree that this movie and its talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve heres hoping that the dvd will do very well and bring both to the attention of wider audience the actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent perhaps overall the movie is little long but may miles thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary good for the actors am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot may miles thomas deserves more recognition from the film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors,positive
had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on danish television yesterday first of all wanted to see gina lollobrigida and here wasnt disappointed she looked gorgeous second of all through reading about the film had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in philippe de brocas films on this account however was sadly disappointed found the jokes predictable apart from few witty remarks on the topic of war and the characters completely onedimensional also the action scenes were done in strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion with no sense of drama at all kept watching until the end but got bored very quickly and just sat there waiting for the scenes with lollobrigida,negative
this film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making the lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all we have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face the jokes are all lame never laughed once it was saturday night there were of us having beer all up for laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room the film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways ruined the night ok so pros and cons pros beautiful setting in hawaii looks good on bluray cons worst acting ever you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday predictable poor plot zero character development forced jokes which fall flat many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma may all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid manhoods cheap,negative
this was my first gaspar noe movie ive watched and have to say was shocked dont mind gore in generally but this isnt even gore its real butchering for some of you couple of scenes may be impossible to see and mean really disgusting leaving aside these aspects the main ideas revealed here and the dialog are quite brilliant when you are given strong argument against bringing new life into the world and the manner in which it is given you cant stop and take minute to think about it the actors did their job well representing general masks of handpick few people found at the bottom of diseased society the movie is full of metaphors but ill let you figure them out dont watch it if you want to have lite relaxing time recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema,positive
agree with bigalc this movie actually prepared me for lot of the cultural differences and practices before went to live in japan for year in tom selleck does fantastic job here as always and the movie is greatly humorous and educational im big fan of tom sellecks and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part bringing the film to life in way cant imagine any other actor being able to pull off this film featured some firstrate japanese actors and it was highly entertaining to watch them as they interacted with selleck can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie japans an awesome place to go whether you want to party sightsee or just try to take everything in,positive
laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of pretty boy jack black in this role gandolfini gives his typical performance the entire cast is funny the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy can identify with loneliness during the holidays andor putting up with the relatives the best part to this film to me anyway were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped namely the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree go see it and have good laugh,positive
although lived in australia in moved overseas not long after fed up with constant industrial unrest the general worship of mediocrity unless one is sportsman and the complacency of so many australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in countries to their north consequently missed the dismissal along with many other australianmade tv dramas of the 80s and 90s such as the superb janus and phoenix series which have since seen along with wildsideto me the filmed story of the dismissal is fair and as far as am aware accurate however as to public outrage it only shows one side of the picture not how families were riven by the controversy know as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward but the commentary is in my view very onesided throughout the inescapable fact is that notwithstanding fiery expressions of rage from substantial proportion of the community the australian electorate chose and chose decisively in favour of fraser as they did again two years later this apart historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama,positive
may be good old boy from virginia in the confederate states of america but this man does it for me that mustache gets me riled up remember when first saw video of his that girl he beat was amazing the depth of his acting when they cut to his weathered facade was new level of masculinity it reminds me of the granite sculptures of our mt rushmore if could ask him one question it would beif you were hotdog would you eat yourself will orhan be doing reunion tour take note from the greats like gordon lightfoot true music from the heart never fades away vive la john denver gracias my friend offl orhan fan for life,positive

the problem is the role of the characters in the film man to man shows british anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself the problem is the role of the pygmies in the film two people who are kidnapped treated like animals and yet given such shallow stereotypical role within the film the kidnapper british anthropologist ends up being the hero of the film because he manages to relate to the pygmies no notion of how the two hostages feel of their point of view of their ordeal find it is shallow film with one sided fundamentally racist view it never manages to move away from the white mans view,negative
life begins and ends in typical 1930s maternity recovery ward where we view hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women played by loretta young glenda farrell clara blandick aunty em vivienne osborne dorothy tree and gloria shea as they await to give birth while the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted it does offer us look back in time to see what giving birth in typical city hospital in was like for our grandmothers and greatgrandmothers found the film fascinating and exceptionally movingoddly enough the most outstanding performance in this film comes from male cast member young eric linden as jed sutton graces loretta young husband what an actor as first time father jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off cafeteria table felt his every concern keenly id like to see more of this actors work he had very emotional voice which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia who screamed dont cut dont cut as scarlett fled the hospital in horror chilling another great performance is from aline macmahon who plays miss bowers the nurse her character is salt of the earth type the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show more humane side of the medical professionloretta young did another superb acting job here as well very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace my she is great in these precodes ive really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few monthsglenda farrell played her role of shrill unwed mother little over the top for my taste didnt anyone know back in that swigging brandy from hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies health but her character redeems herself in the endalso in the cast was an uncredited gilbert roland silent movie star as grieving italian husband his screen time was brief but notablelife begins is mustsee precode try to catch it sometime on tcm but remember to bring few hankies to cry into out of,positive
this is great film touching and strong the direction is without question breathless good work to the team feel so sorry for marlene by the grace of god go you or,positive
think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toiletpaper no respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie for example the names of some serbian terrorists that remember are caradan maldic ivanic loyvek and leo hasse what kind of names are that certainly not serbian by the way caradan maldic what name laughed for days thinking about it probably an implication on karadzic and mladic secondly there have never been any cases of terrorism done by serbians journalist like the main character ought to have known that thirdly the actors playing serbian terrorists are not even serbs nor do they speak serbocroatian all this aside this movie is solidly acted but the story is paperthin and full of holes at times it makes no sense whatsoever,negative
criticism does mention spoilersi rarely make user comments but this is one movie have no problem slandering this movie stinks and its mediocre of rating of and half stars is probably too high for such pulp the bone collector is not at all the same calibre of film that silence of the lambs or seven were despite what its ad claims this is perfect example of how not to make thriller the pace of this movie was extremely slow actually left for about minutes halfway through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression refer to you the part where angelina jolies character debates denzel about cutting off corpse hands the movie is not at all scary but tries to compensate this with lovesubplot albeit sexy angelina jolies character and denzel washingtons of course what you get is something comparable to that of the mentorstudent relationship as seen in the brillian epic silence of the lambs with hannibal lecter and starling however even this lacks all effectiveness and was personally routing for the villain to kill denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two with such crappy movie was halfexpecting plottwist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit things that mediocre movies like arlington road and scream pulled off anybody with 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved situation which mimicks alfred hitchcocks rear window the cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen esoterically speaking even think the murderers intention was completely lost as denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial chess game and gets with his pet project angelinaif you are fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts like am you will not appreciate this film if you have not attended single movie in your life and would like to catchup on every single hollywood cliche ever borne the latenight knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer the ridiculous serialkiller to prime investigator relationship the horrible woman trying to get by in an allmale dominated workforce aka sotl see this moviebut even then its too slowpaced and youd be bored,negative
possible spoilers perhaps must say that cinderella ii dreams come true is one of the worst movies ever made first of all the movie was made during the height of disneys sequel rampage it was created around the same time as the little mermaid ii the jungle book ii and peter pan ii all of which were disservices to their original film classics disney also made the hunchback of notre dame ii and atlantis ii but im going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place let me go ahead and say that am an avid supporter of good disney films and absolutely adore the original disney cinderella the sequel to cinderella however was waste of time the character of cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that grew up watching in the original cinderella was kind and loving the new cinderella had very outofcharacter moments with currentera phrasing like im going to do this banquet my way let me also tell you that new cinderella as have affectionately named her says ewww that is the anticinderella try to find the best in people but in the sequel anastasia one of the stepsisters is good what the heck why they made it all out to be like lady tremaine and drizella are just horrible family members for poor little anastasia my question to the world did the people at disney watch the original cinderella when making this sequel well it surely doesnt seem so if remember correctly anastasia was just as abusive to cinderella as drizella and lady tremaine am all for redemption and forgiveness but there was no point of redemption for anastasia in this movie in the first one anastasia was evil in the second one she is good one just cant leave story like this hope disney realizes that this movie among other movies is shaming walt disneys name perhaps now that michael eisner is gone things will start shaping up around the house of mouse,negative
hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of 8s this movies true scoreas mentioned before chris rock is the king previous to going to see this movie wasnt that over the top about him but now im banging on the doors of chris rocks website begging him to take me on as his protege this film is truly funny if you dont find this movie funny you really need therapy and its humour which targets all areas of society including racepredictably class division love wealth employment dreams stand up comedy the list goes onthere was one slight disappointment for me however this was that in going into this film didnt realise that it was actually remake of heaven can wait another quite good movie made in with warren beatty as such was quite surprised when watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie had watched on tv few weeks ago regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that chris rock is funnier than warren beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of anyyou get the picturewell to the actual plot of the filmdont spoil the experience for yourself dont read the plot just go and watch movie because there have been two reviews on imdb so far that have raved mad about it go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in long time go and see it because its cinema experience that doesnt leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets go see it because it is good movie,positive
formula movie about the illegitimate son of rich chilenian who stands to inherit fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with beautiful female lawyer vargas it looks very much like tv movie not really exciting the only reason bothered to see it was because valentina vargas was in it no real surprises here though it is nice to see vargas great looking chilenian landscapes on display but malcolm mcdowells part is very small and doesnt add much to the movie michael ironside plays as usual bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts the chase scenes are standard fare,negative
whatever rating give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome otherwise this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor her downward phase and richard burton his miscasting phase tennessee williams wrote the milk train doesnt stop here anymore and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his playbut apparently he was the only one taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the moneywhatever it amounts to hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner exploding at the servants and exchanging bad babytalk with no less than noel coward who seems to be visitor from another film when he finally appearsits so campy that among taylor fans its probably considered must see kind of thing but if you can sit through this one without drink in your hand youre way ahead of me sadly this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as film actress even after winning two oscars for burton it was equally disastrous and the critics called it bomb judge for yourself if you dare,negative
viva la bam this jackass spin off focuses on the obviously scripted adventures of bam margera and his pals johnny knoxville brandon dicamillo etc this show while it has its fair share of grossout comedy and crazy stunts focuses mainly on bams torturing of his parentsim sorry to say this bam but youre in no way as cool as you think you are this ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny and yes liked jackass but also narcissistic beyond belief the overly stylized intro ends with bam coolly explaining that hes going to do whatever the he wants to how about you do something that is actually funny liked jackass for what it was worth the camerawork was horrible any idiot could have made better show with camcorder in their parents garage but at least the show moved at steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performednot so with viva la bam we follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy the stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining but presented in such tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smileviva la bam is poor spinoff of that does little good but feed margeras already too big ego dont recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone,negative
had never heard of larry fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing he should keep his day job as journeyman actor like many others on here dont know how to categorize this film it wasnt scary or spooky so cant be called horror the plot was so wafer thin it cant be drama there was no suspense so it cant be thriller its just bad film that you should only see if you were fan of the blair witch project people who liked this film used words like ambiguity and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasnt there like the blair witch people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying this movie actually started off well with the family meeting the locals after hitting deer it looked like being modern day deliverance but then for the next minutes well over half the film nothing happened the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining it was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in movie finally when something does happen its not even clear how the father was shot how he dies the nurse said his liver was only grazed and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects the film is called wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied would have bailed out with minutes to go but wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself it didnt,negative

suppose for this film was supposed to be cool but looking back now years its charm was just as silly as its entertainment value granted the special effects do well on tv with the series that started in but for the big screen once had fish tank that was equally as exciting must agree about the octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the seaview obviously not well stagedor trained overall its pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and still do recommend it for fun laughs sake this was probably one of irwin allens biggest films and think he thought lot of it barabara eden went on to play genie on tv micheal ansara was her husband now that is cool part about this film always enjoyed seeing real life husband and wife teams star in the same movie neat,negative
this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kongs new wave that began with tsui harks zu warriors of magic mountain tsui set tone for the new waves approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave jackie chan sammo hung wong jing ching siu tung etc accepted from then on as given namely the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than touch of irony if not outright comedy burning paradise put stop to all that and with vengeanceits not that there isnt humor here but it is purely human humor as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in bundle of straw but this is just as humans are not even buddhist priests can be saints all the timewhen irony is at last introduced into the film it is the nastiest possible emanating from the abbot of red lotus temple who is study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before he is the very incarnation of miltons satan from paradise lost better to rule in hell than serve in heaven and if he cant get to satans hell soon enough hell turn the world around him into living hell he can rulethats the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here its not that the abbot just wants to kill people he wants them to despair to feel utterly hopeless to accept his nihilism as allencompassing reality thus theres definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself it has become all there is to the universe and the abbot claiming mastery of infinite power is in chargeof course fortunately the film doesnt end there though there are losses the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails if you want to know how see the film yet there is no doubt that in viewing this film we visit hell hopefully we do not witness our own afterlives but we certainly feel chastened by the experience and somehow better for it over all,positive

as soon as it hits screen it destroys all intelligent life forms around but on behalf of its producers must say it doesnt fall into any known movie category it deserves brand new denomination of its own its neurological drama it saddens and depresses every single neuron inside persons brainits the closest thing one will ever get to stroke without actually suffering one it drives you speechless all you members go numb your mouth falls open and remains so and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deafno small feat for such sort of moviethe only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage,negative

this is very noir kind of episode it begins with jim returning from weekend trip with new girlfriend the recently divorced karen mills pat delaneydaughter in law of john huston who knew few things about noir film and her daughter when they arrive karen goes in the house while jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her up to her room he then discovers karen has disappeared without trace of course he calls dennis and when the police arrive they see no sign of karen but find her next door neighbor murdered in the bushes so of course that makes jim an immediate suspectthis is great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by rocky asking jim to go over the story once again rocky suggests that by jim telling him the story he might remember little detail that he didnt think was important at the time but now might lead to clue as to what happened its really well written scene and completes the transition of the rocky character from grifter to concerned parent it also goes long way to show that rocky isnt just some clueless old man either as he says you come to me because im your father and im smarter than you this is one of those times where we see where jim got his smartsthis episode also features an appearance by hottie lara parker who played angelique in the dark shadows series and went on to play laura banner bruces wife in the incredible hulk series few years later she looks terrific herethis episode also marks the first mention of the minette crime family name that would keep popping up on the rockford files almost whenever they needed mob family this time its vincent minette who rockford helps apprehendlt diehl tom atkins makes his first appearance on the series and dennis is quietly demoted from police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to police sargent guess they figured it would be better to have dennis less powerful and add some conflict between jim and the police frankly they were right though prefer the later lt chapman to lt diehl not lot of the typical rockford humor in this episode but good mystery with lot of heart,positive
the royal rumble has traditionally been one of my favourite events and ive been wrestling fan for good few years now the other shows may have better matches but ive always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitementim not going to reveal the winners of any match as dont see it as fair to ruin the results on review will comment on the quality of them thoughwe have the standard matches and then the big rumble event two from smackdown and two from rawshawn michaels and edge open up for raw this proves to be good match from two talented guys this is match id recommend watching its hard to sum up without giving away the winnernext we have the usual undertaker against some big nasty monster be whoever it is giant gonzales yokozuna kamala well this time its heidenreich its also casket match typical undertaker fare watch if youre fan have to admit am purely for the entertainment factor it can hardly be regarded as classic wrestling matchthe next two matches are the title matches for once smackdown manages to upstage raw their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable but with anticlimax and let down to end it raws match is pretty dull and boring affair which is pity as im fan of both guys involvednow to the main reason love the event the rumble its pretty good one this year coming up to the event we all had pretty good idea of who might win and it may not prove big surprise but hey its very enjoyable there are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated there is the token guy who doesnt make it to the ring the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished and someone gets eliminated by previously eliminated combatant it has its usual highs and lows and loved the ending in particular the vince mcmahon entranceid recommend this show not the wwe on top form but its still good add it to your collection,positive

this movie was way overhyped lot of the viewers who thought this was amazing must have been into the old school movies cause the whole movie is set in the past at first thought the movie was just showing something from the past so was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass but it just going basically this was movie trying to mix the future with the past and the dont mix very well in this movie even with special effects you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying its the greatest movie ever done its just crap on stick it also didnt help that the story line was sooo crappy dont understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced and also dont understand how actorsactresses in this movie are willing to be in movie like this its almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine printit will all be done on computer this was movie that should have been on movie network because nothing about this movie was revolutionary im very upset with myself for paying money to see this whatever you do dont waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow,negative
it is incredible that there were two films with the same story released in this one came out day before that other one with tom cruise didnt they do that with truman capote the same year and the zodiac killer last year interestingwriterdirector david michael latt didnt have steven spielbergs budget and thomas howell is not tom cruise this is pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed million worldwidethe action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of rhett giles who played pastor that was giving up on his godgary busey was creepy as an army lt,negative
dunno sometimesyou try and try and try to be charitable towards all the thru grade movies out there but once in while particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved bat people which saw under the title it lives by night is just such movie you cant watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on night gallery and not one of the better ones either the movie has something to do with doctor who gets bitten by bat and consequently starts to morph into werebat who drinks human blood actually youd think if he was turning into real bat hed be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket but because this is cheap lurid horror movie bloods the word in spite of the fact that he has grandmal seizures at the drop of hat and blackout episodes almost every night his friend and fellow physician dr mustache aspenextreme insists that hes just having an allergic reaction to the rabies shots meanwhile the worlds most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls and one wino also meanwhile the doctors wife decides that denial is river in egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction its not so much that the acting is bad you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script even the guy who plays the sheriff okay it is pretty bad but its bad in clichéd wooden professional way its just that everything about the acting the way the scenes are paced the costumes the dialog the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to well slap everyone involvedi think the movie had an outside chance at being spooky unsettling little cult favorite but1the director needed to beat michael pataki an experienced character actor with chair until pataki agreed to act and not just channel dennis weaver 2he also needed to find script that made little more sense with regard to the whole bat bites human who then turns into bat scenario he also needed the actor who played the doctor to find little more physically believable bit of stage business for his episodes instead of resorting to man has seizure page from the little golden book of clichéd acting mannerisms he needed to rework the whole wife character make her both more intelligent less shrill and waaaaay more observant would never voluntarily watch this film again except with the help of mike and the bots its bad but it isnt bad in silly humorous or interesting way still better than battlefield earth or waterworld though,negative
big fat liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing great production and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent pap the two stars work great together andwhat can say amanda bynes shines putting irkel and lee majors in the film were brilliant touches watch this film with your kids if you dont laugh throughout it you must not have been paying attention,positive
tim robbins and john cusack are two actors have appreciated throughout their careers and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie well all can say is totally regretted it these two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing number of irrelevant unimaginative and kitch to the extreme not that this is bad on its ownsketches that are supposed to make people laugh but fail to do so the only reason can think is that the director was their friend and they decided to support his movie by starring in iti cant think of anything else because this movie is so cheap fortunately tim robbins and john cusack havent disappointed me ever since would recommend you to avoid this film unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled,negative
on watching this film was amazed at how media perception can mould persons opinion of celebrity karen carpenter was carefree but very unconfident young lady whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs as with all celebrities of today they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks styles etc this had huge effect on karen who raged battle against her eating and drastically lost weight which eventually caused her death this heart felt film was not initially something which would have thought of watching but on starting to view it then was hooked in the same way that the tina turner story does then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life the acting was superb and even after nearly years after it was made then the directional and the dialogue are still entertainingi would recommend this to anyone who hasnt yet watched it it is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged,positive
nothing is sacred just ask ernie fosselius these days everybody has video camera and movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying quickly written and shot and often posted directly to the internet spoofs are hot these days and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers dont get off on their own selfimportance years ago when the first star wars was made it was different world filmmaking was the playground of select few and spoofs were very rare then god gave us hardware wars it was shot to look cheap or was it just cheap and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact does that take away from the experience heck no thats what makes it so great it was raw and unpolished and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie from fluke starbucker waving around flashlight instead of lightsaber did that when was young to chewchilla the wookie monster to auggie ben doggies nah just little headache remark this film short is as much part of the phenomenon as any of the actual star wars films rent it buy it borrow it from friend and may the farce be with you always,positive
hated it hate selfaware pretentious inanity that masquerades as art this film is either stupidly inane or inanely stupid after the first half hour fastfowarded through the dvd version and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over became angered that had spent hardearned money for sophomoric claptrap tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make something movie let alone art,negative
usually try to be professional and constructive when criticize movies but my god this was the worst movie have ever seen bad acting bad effects bad script bad everything the plot follows group of teen cliches on their way to rave that takes place in broad daylight at remote island however when the group arrives all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes determined to find out what happened to the rest of the partygoers the clan sets off on mission through zombieinfested forest during this crusade they are aided by police chick and sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids they also meet up with jonathan cherry and some other survivors basically the rest of the movie is collection of poorly directed action sequences including far too long shootout outside of the house of the dead this fight came complete with cheesy hollywood violence redundant clips from the hotd video game and sloppy matrixesque camera rotations one of the characters even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others why not because he was noble and brave but because part of his face got scarred by acid zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled im supposed to feel sorry for this guyto sum it all up there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is the theater was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen and im sure the money wasted seeing this piece of sht could easily cover the costs it took to make it grade,negative
if you like me is going to see this in film history class or something like that at your school try to convince your teacher to see something else believe me anything is better than this movie it is slow paced confusing boring poorly constructed gory gringy do need to go on its message is good but have seen them been handled better in several other films the acting isnt even any good this movie is just even more awkward as it start off as being funny not intensional thoughbecause of its surreal story than at the end just becomes uncomfortable to watchi honestly feel like hour and minutes of my life has been robbed why would anyone want to watch girls describe threesome for minutes than watch them drive through traffic jam for minutes listen to hippie who can make sheep appear witness sort of rape than see the female lead role eat her husbandhonestly this movie deserves nothing but and if your not happy with my previewseriously im an open minded guy and like movies that protest through symbolism but this movie was just awful make any excuse you can to avoid this film,negative
